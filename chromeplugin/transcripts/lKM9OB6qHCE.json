{"video_id": "lKM9OB6qHCE", "transcript": " Does working out at night hurt your sleep? Is that really true? Is there truly no other time for you to work out? And this is interesting because I've been talking about resting heart rate as the single most important biomarker in my entire life as all the efforts we've done basically collapsed into this marker. So to me this was really cool to see that things that increased your resting heart rate before bed negatively impact your sleep and exercise may be counterintuitively is one of those things. Today we're going to talk about two things which I'm really, really excited about because they're both incredibly practical and they're also zero cost. So a lot of people if they're doing like saunas and coal plunge, great. Also if they're not doing these basic things they can be missing out and also starting out their health off in a bad start. So I'm really, really excited to talk about these two things. One is the whoops sleep study that got published and the second thing is resting heart rate. So we're going to dive into both those topics today. Yeah, I'm super excited about this work study. Like this is, this is just really exciting for me because this is like really great data that I think the medical community and longevity community has been waiting on since we started using these these wearable devices and to actually see this getting published is just super cool because it's just going to, it's in my mind going to change the way we think about research in a lot of ways. I'm wondering why did it take this long to get a study? I mean we've had this data. I mean wearables have been really part of the health community for over a decade now and you can argue that the quality was maybe on some kind of improvement trend but why did it take that long to get a study out on this basic thing? They had four million nights of biometric data. So that took a little while to gather I guess. But you know I think like there's not money behind this. You know like when you look at like what NIH funds they don't fund sleep studies, right? Like you know like lifestyle studies are not backed by you know pharma or any other financial institutions. So you've got to have companies or people that are like you know inherently motivated to produce this type of research. So it's just it's hard to hard to get your hands on hard to get hard to get backed. When I read these kinds of studies I'm always reminded of the the basic premise that we are not taught the the basic elements of health in society. So we in school we learn sex ed great we take drivers lessons to before we get our license but we do not learn the basics of sleep. We don't understand that is it better to exercise in the morning or the night and so these really fundamental basic questions of life are just unanswered. You can live an entire lifetime and never actually be taught how to sleep and before I really went into this deeply even in reading all the books I read there was never actually a practical guide on how to structure your life around sleep. So I think the study actually bridges nicely to these these two topics apparently the study on on exercise and sleep then also resting heart rate. So this will be an episode everyone that you can send to your friends and family and to those you want to introduce to health and wellness like Kate was saying these are very practical tips that everybody can do and you don't have to spend any money. So the study that referencing it's my whoop this is the wearable from whoop so essentially wear it on your wrist some people wear it on their bicep but they analyzed 4.3 million nights of sleep which is an insane amount of data across 15,000 whoop members and they were asking the question does working out at night hurt your sleep and so what they found was that I'm going to read this list here. Strenulus strenuous evening workouts can delay sleep on the shortened sleep duration and reduce sleep quality elevated nocturnal heart rate and decreased heart rate variability were observed after high strain evening stress or evening exercise and workouts concluding at least four hours before bedtime showed no negative impact on sleep. So essentially the TLDR is that if you work out too close to bed especially high strain it will negatively impact your sleep which is such practical and useful information. What do you guys think? 100% like the interesting thing for me about the study is one the size so you know 14,000 participants I think in every room can realize that's huge 4 million biometric data points or nights of biometric data is also huge so huge study when you compare to the prior research we had in this area is really small studies and a lot of subjective data so a lot of like survey yes I slept well no I didn't sleep well yes I exercised no I didn't exercise now we're actually getting like exercise metrics so we understand not only how intensely someone is exercising but how long they're exercising and then when they're exercising and reference to when they normally fall asleep which is another really interesting aspect of the study that I didn't realize at first but they're not just looking at when you exercise in reference to when you fell asleep that day they're looking in when you exercise versus when you normally fall asleep what's your habitual sleep pattern look like so if you stayed up later but you ended up exercising past your normal bedtime that was noted in the study and this kind of information is things that we just haven't had access to before so it's really changing the the breadth and depth of data that we've had on sleep in exercise previously yeah some other data points from the study is the highest intensity exercise two hours before bedtime increased resting heart rate by 3.9 beats per minute which is 6.8% and HRV down was 32.6% they showed a a lessened recovery with any with exercise between two and six hours before bedtime so even they they highlight the four hour marker but really it's two to six hour window where you're lessening recovery you increased resting heart rate you lower HRV and this is interesting because I have been Mike you can attest to this I have been talking I hate you can too I have been talking about resting heart rate as the single most important biomarker my entire life as all the efforts we've done basically collapse into this marker so to me this was really cool to see that I really things that increased your resting heart rate before bed negatively impact your sleep and exercise maybe counter intuitively is one of those things so even if you do exercise and you feel great you're like I don't think it affects me in it you know calm seem down from from stress it really has widespread effects within the body so to me I thought this was a really great we never had data actually large scale data that showed I mean actually there's a few studies but this is a good one to show the correlation of resting heart rate and sleep quality and recovery and they found that it was dose dependent to so the higher the intensity of the exercise the longer duration so they use this metric called strain which is basically intensity and duration combined and they call that strain so maximal strain had a bigger impact on your sleep the closer it was to your bedtime as compared to like light strain for example so they actually found that the higher the intensity that longer the duration actually led to worse outcomes the more we increase those those two factors so it really is dose dependent with the best outcome happening with you basically exercise if you're going to have high intensity exercise doing it you know six plus hours before bedtime that's when there's you know virtually no change whatsoever although one thing that was interesting is even in the maximal strain group and there was a change in resting heart rate even if you did it that morning so there was actually a slight increase in resting heart rate but in terms of overall sleep metrics very much dose response mediated yeah and this was actually if I remember correctly worse the folks that weren't already exercising a lot and so if you're like getting into a new routine it's new year and you're exercising a lot before bed you you actually affected worse when it comes to your sleep quality is that right yeah they found it affected everybody though even like pro athletes so they they they did find that it didn't matter gender you know your experience with exercise in terms of whether there was an effect the grain of there may have been more effect if if you are less trained and that's probably has to do with the sympathetic activation so the cortisol response if you don't exercise very regularly you're more likely to have a higher like you know cortisol stress response to that exercise so it's going to take your system longer to relax afterwards so that you get back in that paracetacic state and actually get to sleep that makes kind of sense and I was someone who was for a long time taking long walks before going to sleep do we know if you were doing a chill workout with that still negatively affect your sleep so chill workouts if they're done more than two hours before bed did not affect sleep in any significant way so yeah like yoga slow walk things like that and the actual effect if it was done within two hours before bed was pretty minimal compared to like strainy was activity okay so then what would be the protocol that someone should follow takes over me the greeting the study what what I would suggest and I think like my takeaway what I'm going to start telling friends patients myself that strenuous exercise should happen at least four hours before bed probably closer to six hours before bed so if you are going to exercise within that far window before bed it really should be light activity it should be yoga it should be walking but you shouldn't go for a half marathon you shouldn't play hockey game you know you shouldn't do anything super super strenuous and then try to go to sleep immediately because it's just going to wreck your sleep yeah this goes back to what Brian was saying about like the habits and society reading this reminded me of my cousin who's a professional soccer player and he's constantly playing at like crazy hours of the day and that's just part of his profession and he's always talking about how he can't go to sleep and so it feels really practical and also it's a so one of those situations where I'm sure playing people at home are listening to this and like man I can't fit a workout in in the morning how do I do this and I think that's something I had to adjust with my protocol to two is like actually I need to go to sleep earlier even though that's not my typical M.O. and life so that I can do something in the morning workout because I also saw in my personal anecdotal data that my general health at all was worse when I excised in the afternoons so I love how practical it is Brian have you noticed I know you track your resting heart rate every single night have you noticed that days that you do higher intensity exercise it's higher where does it go back down for you yes my life experience and conclusions basically mirrored this paper I've been telling others to follow these protocols for years and so to me it's really a great point of validation that a lot of people when they when they talk about health protocols they immediately jump to oh well I must be different and things need to be personalized to me and I think the actual correct thinking is the inverse where we have more in common than we do in different and I don't know the certain areas maybe like maybe 70% in common or 80% in common or 90% in common even 99% in common but we do share so much in common with our shared biology that we're really trying to find the exception more than the rule and the rule here is late night exercise and a high intensity it did negatively affect my sleep I saw in the data is very clear increase my HRV I'm sorry increase my resting heart rate lower my HRV lower my recovery I just wouldn't feel as good and so that was very obvious to me like early on in the game of doing this and so you can also take these same principles and map them to every other part of life the same rules apply so I would just encourage people that when on topics of health and wellness try to find the rule the power law that applies to you and all of us and then you can pull off the exceptions but I think it's a mistake and thought process to find the exception above the rule because usually we again we have more in common okay I'm gonna answer tough question you might not have an answer but what would you say is worse not exercising or if you can't fit it in or exercising before bed like wait for someone's making a trade off what would you prefer they do you're gonna ask this question it's tough one yeah I'm interested to hear what your thoughts are on this Brian I guess my first like where I go to first is is that really true like can we challenge the the notion that you can't exercise anytime other than right before bed I mean I'll answer the question anyway but my first thought is like can we really challenge that that thought process is there truly no other time for you to work out and I'm sure there's people out there there's edge cases where that's your only option in that case I would say that this data would suggest it's better to do a lighter type of exercise but if that's true every single day of your life that would mean all you would ever get to do is light exercise because you would be worried about messing up your sleep and if that's truly the case this has got to be less than like one in a thousand but if that's truly the case then I would say there were some days that you need to just exercise harder and it's gonna hurt your sleep some because like we know the the that exercise is such a huge has such a huge impact in longevity where you know higher VO2 is having 300 400 percent decreased risk of mortality there's obviously a huge benefit to exercise so if there's truly a situation where you can only exercise maximally in the evening right before bed then I would say some days you need to sacrifice sleep for that exercise love it super practical yeah I would I would say a an additional opinion a contemplation for that is that I think sleep deserves being the number one spot in everyone's life above family above work above everything it is the fuel source of existence and the the challenges and I saw this in my life is there were times where for example I would overeat at night and I would be so upset with myself that I would then exercise and be like I've now have to work this off like I just can't go to bed because I'm really upset which of course is a double whammy because now your full your body is your heart rate's high it's trying to digest the food and you've exercise in a stenuous fashion and then when that happens you try to go to sleep you can't your hot your heart rate's pounding then you wake up the next morning you feel absolutely awful you do not feel like exercising and then you have lower willpower and so now you're more likely to eat bad foods again and get in the same cycle and I was only able to break my bad cycles because I would I would prioritize sleep above all which when you do that it increases your willpower it improves your likelihood of your going to exercise it improves your eagerness to eat well and so I hear you Mike and there's certainly edge cases here where a person has a life circumstance where their responsibilities begin at four or five in the morning they don't finish until two or three in the afternoon then they've got you know children responsibilities so certainly there are people listening who cannot do this for structural reasons I agree but I just know that in my life when I haven't been able to sleep well everything else in my life falls apart I am more sensitive to stress to negativity to mood swings it just throws me off entirely so I'm guessing most people feel the same but I hear you it's a tricky tradeoff because exercise does also counteract that in some ways like if you're in a bad night sleep you can't exercise and actually do yourself some good to get back on your two feet I know like when I've had a bad night sleep traveling internationally a really hard workout like reset me in a fresh way so yeah it's not to say this is the only way it's only to try to to point out that you can never overestimate the gains of high quality sleep I definitely found that to be true for me too that like my day tomorrow is a direct correlation to how well I set myself up by going to sleep all right you guys ready to move on to the second topic yes okay so Brian you've been investing years and years of your life millions of dollars to try and figure out this longevity protocol and you've distilled it into one thing so you say here I've become the most measured person in history and if all the things are measured there's one mark out that I value above all of them which is high praise so this thing is resting hot rate before bed what is that yeah and Mike I don't think we've ever actually walked through this together these are all my distillations so I'd love to hear your take on this okay so the hypothesis is this that yeah sleep is the number one most effective performance and hatching drug available to every humans every human and they're therefore warrants getting high quality sleep as your number one objective and the most influential variable determining whether or not you're going to have high quality sleep is your resting heart rate before bed and the reason why it's a linchpin to predict that is because if you eat a heavy meal before bed your resting heart rate is going to increase and your sleep quality will decrease if you drink alcohol before bed your resting heart will increase and your sleep quality will decrease if you are in a high stressed state or you know in a rouse you'll get a fight or you're worried about something that too will increase your heart rate and so if you start listing out all the things in life that increase your resting heart rate it's most of the vices we have in society right it's stress conflict overeating alcohol stimulants doom scrolling you know screens it's all these things that we know are not good for us they have a direct relationship with increasing the resting heart rate lowering sleep quality which then starts this vicious cycle and now I have less willpower I'm less likely to work out and then it also has a bunch of these other positive effects where if I have a low resting heart rate I go to sleep I'm going to have high quality sleep which means I'm more likely to exercise if I'm exercise I'm more likely to eat well if I eat well you know I have much more willpower except suck well and eat well and now I'm not going to eat the bad food or take this to make this kind of debatuous behavior and so I can go through more detail but basically it captures an entire person's life it's a single number of record that is an accounting for all of their behaviors I like it I mean it is a you're right resting heart rate is a good metric for autonomic system performance so what is your sympathetic versus parasympathetic what's your fight or flight versus your rest in rest and digest right like that's the it encapsulates your body's current physiology around that particular state whether you've been you know drinking caffeine or smoking nicotine or taking THC or on a stimulant or exercise recently or digesting all those things are going to show up in your resting heart rate so it is a very simple and easy metric of that I wonder if I would have you looked at heart rate variability at all as a as an additional metric on top of resting heart rate in terms of like evening heart rate variability and sleep performance the same relationship every time my heart rate so my heart rate is directly correlated with my HIV when it's down well my heart rate is low HIV's up when HIV a heartbeat is up HIV's down yeah and just for everybody who's listening to HIV heart rate variability you actually want more variability more variability means more parasympathetic nervous system activation and less variability means more sympathetic nervous system activation so more stress the lower your heart rate variability it's just get everybody on board with that and resting heart rate to clarify is that when you're going to sleep this is the average number while you're at rest while you're sleeping is that right so overnight what your heart rate is while you're laying down asleep not doing any kind of activity yeah generally resting heart rate is when we talk about it in medicine we're usually talking about the lowest heart rate that you have at rest which generally happens middle of the night like 3am something like that Brian's talking about a resting heart rate measured at a particular time point right Brian that's correct so they may be slightly different but they're not super different I mean like few beats Brian do you find that your heart rate before bed is the same as because we will give you a resting heart rate which is while you're sleeping if I'm mistaken so do you find those two numbers at the same like when you're going to sleep it's the same yeah yeah so what I have a ritual before I go to bed right before I go to bed I hit my my head on the pillow I'll pull up the app and I'll see what my resting heart rate is at and I'll do a breathing exercise for about 60 seconds and that will settle me down and typically I'll be somewhere between 44 beats per minute and 55 so 44 beats per minute means I had a perfect day and I can walk through these things that's with it related to the food consumption like the amount of food and the type of food my stress levels my preparedness for sleep my wind down routine and so when 44 beats per minute is on screen I'm gonna have a guaranteed perfect night sleep now I should clarify on screen the light is so all blues are out and it's a low the lowest possible light to be on the phone so it's the least light exposure possible with no blues and everything is down oh you almost can't see it so dim and that's the perfect night but if I do that exercise and I'm at 55 to 57 it's gonna be a rough night and so there's a few things that can cause that like maybe I've traveled somewhere internationally maybe our my food schedule got messed up because I couldn't eat in the morning because of something and I had to eat later in the day or there's a certain things that can get or I exercise in the evening like I did a dance party or something and so it's now I know this so well having done this a few hundred times that I can predict with unbelievable accuracy REM and deep NHRV just base upon that alone okay did you notice how quickly he like clarified the the screen light and everything he's like I see the comments he's like he's like we've just seen the comments coming right now I'm just gonna clarify this yeah which is true when you switch it over to red it's um if you guys don't know this at home it's such a cool feature you can set up your phone so that you can triple tap and switch it and it really cuts out all light which is great so that's what Brian's referring to yeah that's so crazy that this is so this is something that I experienced early on doing blue prints like Brian would say all these things and I was always very skeptical like is that is that really is he just you know experiencing something as as a one off and is it gonna apply to me but I found the same thing that across doing this if my heart rate is higher than usual I know it's gonna impact my sleep quality I know my HRV is gonna have like a 20% drop the next day so it's definitely true like you you build up these intuitions with your numbers and resting heart rate is one of the most important things to predict that and so and if I'm not mistaken there's a bad things that you can do before bed so like exercising eating late that kind of stuff arousing yourself with a a fight um but also you can drive resting heart rate down with better fitness is that right yeah 100% so like one of the benefits of resting heart rate as a as a marker a longevity health marker is beyond sleep quality it's actually like it's actually something that I think we should probably look at more in the medical community as a measure of overall health because it is directly affected by overall stress so how much stress you live in your life the more stress you are the higher your cortisol response the higher sympathetic activation the higher your resting heart rate is going to be by a few beats by physical fitness so the more fit you are the lower your resting heart rate is going to be and there's actually been good studies that show that you know even a like a 10 beat per minute jump above 60 is equivalent to about a 10% increased risk for cardiovascular disease and the higher you go the higher that increase so if your resting heart rate is 90 that might be equivalent to about a 30% increased risk of cardiovascular disease or all cause mortality as opposed to someone who's resting heart rate is less than 60 so it's a great surrogate for stress physical fitness overall health which we we don't really use it enough I thought I'd love us so much is that it's not only does it keep and check that habits that could otherwise overrun your life but also once you sleep well the probability you're going to exercise the following morning after a great night sleep is very high and that of course has the double benefit right you feel good about yourself but also it's improving your cardiovascular cardiovascular fitness and it's going to lower your resting heart rate so it's this continuous cycle where great sleep leads to great exercise with then lowers the resting heart rate again which thing contributes to you know continuously good sleep so it really captures cardiovascular fitness bad habits high quality sleep so you basically this is why if you can keep your resting heart rate for bed and check it is the number one highest performing the performance that has you drug in the world because it's at the epicenter of all things you do in life yeah both short term and long term yes like what are you eating what's your lifestyle what's your fitness level what are your habits what are your biases it's all ultimately impacted by resting heart rate yeah show me your resting heart rate and reveal your show your soul isn't there to say resting heart rate is the most important biomarker you can track on yourself Mike that's what I would put forward is that it is that if you I mean this would be an interesting assessment to do if you know somebody's resting heart rate what is the what is the relationship to inflammation to body fat to stress levels you know cortisol like if we just looked at that across the board it may be one of if not the most predictive markers of everything else it'd be interesting to try and figure out a way to test that okay let's just like think through a few of these it's highly doubtful that you're going to have a low resting heart rate and B.O.B.s correct yeah there's actually good studies that show that there's an increasing resting heart rate so you see we do see an increase in resting heart rate based on a certain amount of BMI increase so I think it's every five BMI increases resting heart rate goes up by five or something like that it's it there's a direct linear relationship so let's just run through a few more it's it's highly unlikely for you to have a low resting heart rate and B under high stress 100% so let's say how does rest in heart rate relate to inflammation do we think someone can have a low resting heart rate and high inflammation or do you think that one is wouldn't be directly correlated I think there's probably a correlation there I'm not sure if it's as close as stress but I would suspect there's also a correlation there yeah and then you've got physical fitness which is clearly correlated yeah total amount of sleep is actually correlated so the less sleep you get the higher your resting heart rate they're actually like they so they're they're cross correlated right like if your resting heart rates too high you're not going to get good sleep and if you're not getting enough sleep then your resting heart rate is going to be exactly and you could probably also say resting heart rate is highly predictive of V.O.B.s two max one of the best predictors of all cause mortality 100% yeah I mean they usually like pro athletes regularly have heart rates rest in our rates in the in the 40s sometimes even high 30s yeah yeah although as many of these ultra marathon runners they they have very low resting heart rates but they've got they're pre-diabetic so there may be some like some kind of blood glucose insulin dysfunction that is not tied to resting heart rate would that be a possible theory yeah I don't think I think the issue we're seeing there has less to do with a relationship with resting heart rate to pre-diabetes and more an association with how you're eating how are you fueling during exercise the amount of exercise are you over trained that's that's a different more complex relationship I think okay cool so it's it's a contender for probably the you know the most knockout the big ones yeah like yeah if you basically if you have to reduce health to one marker because let's just say you feel overwhelmed you're not quite sure the diet world has you confused with all the things everyone tells you to do exercise there's a million different ways to do it you're confused if you focus on this one marker to simplify your life this is probably the highest value thing anybody can do how long would you need to start seeing results in lowering your heart rate like someone listening at home they're like okay I'm gonna take on this challenge how quickly do you expect them to knock out the increases in heart rate and how quickly do you expect them to start to drive it down beyond just like baseline there I say immediately I think I think pretty quick especially if they're coming from a situation where they're you know not currently cardiovascularly fit they're eating late meals if they're in a high stress environment if they're not sleeping well I think you would see a response very quickly and then you know like a dramatic responses within a couple months would be my may be my estimation and if someone's listening what would be the protocol so we'll use boop but if someone else has a different wearable or they don't have any wearable what would they be able to do right I'm gonna let you answer that when you're the protocol master here okay there's there's a few really important things that are the power laws one is food so I I have my final meal of the day around noon and so that's roughly eight and a half hours before my bedtime I do that with the specific objective of lowering my resting heart rate and so over the years I've run hundreds of experiments eating two hours before bed and three and four and five and six and I found the eating at noon optimizes for my resting heart rate above all other times of eating so one is eat earlier and lighter so if you're starting off if you go to bed at 10 p.m just begin at 8 p.m. as your last meal and then try seven p.m. and six p.m. keep on working your way back you're gonna see a relationship where the earlier you eat the the better your resting heart rate so it's gonna go down number two is actually and also on on number one is the kinds of food you eat matter a lot so some food you eat will actually elevate your resting heart rate so if you have a big piece of pizza or lasagna or you know something hard for the body to digest your bodies got to work harder to digest that versus something like steam vegetables or something like that so you're going to understand and create a relationship that certain foods lower your heart rate and certain foods increase your heart rate and so I've dialed in this is the diet these foods are the best have the best evidence for longevity and they also are going to contribute to lower your resting heart rate how about alcohol really quickly how about alcohol I know a lot of people yeah I just need to have my take yeah it's gonna increase your resting heart for sure I mean like one of the I think uh or is really interesting I think who does this too I'm actually don't use a group I use an a using aura but like it shows you what the impact is across the population of alcohol consumption and it's about a 7% increase at least according to aura of resting heart rate which I'll come on you totally believe and my personal experience when I do drink even though I don't drink very regularly and when I do it's it's very little even one alcoholic drink will increase my resting heart rate by four to five beats come on guys give me a break you got to have fun in life you got to have at least a drink you're gonna have social benefit you're going to have community friendship love you spend your whole life trying not to die you're not living you need to have a drink of alcohol give me a break Brian drop sarcasm I mean what do you say to that I mean so if a person you know they they basically people hear this and it challenges their existing models of reality where their models reality say moderation in all things right is a good thing or you know community is a thing that helps promote wellness and being with friends and laughing and having fun and letting lose and winding down so they'll argue through these various models that it ultimately is more beneficial than not which I think if I'm not mistaken I think I've seen a few papers maybe suggest those kinds of trade-offs how do you guys think about that your your personal my instincts when you ask question like that is to be very soft to be like I can understand what they're coming from like you know it's really hard when our society's built around these social rituals but then I remember what do I do for my life and once you learn the information on how bad something is it changes your relationship with the thing so now if I think about drinking it's just this like it's it's not this like clean lot like I'm gonna have this and I'm gonna really enjoy it it'd be like I'm gonna have this and I'm gonna feel like you know what this is actually really bad for me so I would say like that is probably the biggest thing like educate yourself on what you're doing to your body because once you have that information it's really hard to unlearn it for me I think the the thing that comes up is what is the actual impact of drinking versus not drinking in a social situation how much how much does abstaining impact my ability to connect and and commune with others and I'm not it's not clear to me that it does in an impactful way where it is definitively clear that it impacts my sleep definitively I mean there's no question I was talking to a doctor on Monday and he was making an argument to me that in the morning if he wanted to spend some precious time with his wife they would get a croissant and that having a croissant together would increase their ability to have a shared experience and I was like I don't think that that that is actually a correct hypothesis I don't I don't think a croissant is necessary in this equation and he pushed back again he's like but you know given the arguments of like but it's a shared experience and it's love and and what all the benefits that flow from a loving caring relationship and so I was like okay let's just like look at this from a biochemical perspective we are we are a collection of 35 trillion cells you take the molecular substrate of a croissant and you put it into the body that's going to interact with chemicals is going to have a blood glucose response you're going to have right you're certain inflammatory markers in relation to that like it doesn't there's no law of biology that says the molecular substrate of croissants hold the secret to oxytocin inducement and otherwise good health right like it's just break us down from a a molecular perspective and he's like all right I can see the point that you know like a croissant is not necessary for love in relationship I'm like great like these but I guess the point is even doctors maintain these robust defenses but they it's really we're challenging something that has been part of people's lives for a long time it is alcohol is not necessary to connect and nor our croissants nor is sugar you can connect with another human in the morning you can connect with a human over healthy healthy foods but this idea that somehow getting down and dirty on the debauchery is the secret to happiness I just don't buy but anyway you were going through the protocol on how to get an incredible resting heart rate so the three questions that I have left is so what do you do what do you do if you don't have a wearable how do you measure resting heart rate and then what are the targets that people can have so like for example men and women differing yeah so if you don't have a wearable then just simply put your fingers on the side of your neck and fill your pulse and count the beats for six seconds and then multiply that by 10 that's your baseline of resting heart rate now to do that give yourself around 60 seconds to calm yourself down like lay down take a few deep breaths try to calm your body down and then take that because if you don't give yourself that one minute you're gonna have an elevator heart rate because maybe you've been walking around or something so that's that's your baseline so like a practical thing we're talking about here is let's say you you listen to this today and you want to take this challenge so tonight before you go to bed let's say you take your pulse and it's 60 beats per minute your goal in the next week let's just say is you're gonna try to drop it by 10% so you're gonna try to get to 54 beats per minute by the following week and so to do that you're gonna start with food you're going to eat earlier and lighter so start with two hours move your way on back as you move back you make experience some hunger before bed it's fine it's actually I really enjoyed that that feeling so just learn to get comfortable with a little bit of hunger why you guys laughing just like just thinking of the audience listening to this and being like I'm supposed to enjoy being hungry like what Brian enjoys buses well the average person enjoys so if he has both started laughing at the same time can you is that are you indicating that I'm out of touch that I don't understand perhaps perhaps maybe just like different things other people so the next thing you're going to do is you need to have a wind-out routine so the rule here is screens off 60 minutes before bed and 60 minutes probably feels like an entire work day to most people like 60 minutes without your screen you know like you're going to go through withdrawal symptoms because everybody is addicted to their phone and we just need to be honest it is an addiction full full on and so when you don't have the screen in front of you you're going through this withdrawal symptoms like all the same stuff you would be going to crack or heroin or meth like they're right you're you're going through this psychological experience and so you need to start creating a habit where screens are off and you're doing some kind of nighttime routine where you're reading a book going for a walk light walk you know having a conversation with a friend breathwork meditation a hobby around the house but anything other than scrolling on your phone which is going to induce anxiety create phomo you know create negative social experiences and then you need to have some kind of wind-out routine I'll stop there first and come back what do you think about that screens off 60 minutes before bed well it's great love it yeah minimum I figured this out on my own as I think most of us do like that's my that's my necessity I and it for me it's actually more than 60 minutes it's it's more like two hours I seem to have a elevated cortisol response especially to work email so like I just got a like I actually like for the most part cut that off at 6 p.m. like just no more emails and so if I am on my screen it's not like it's not like you know yeah Kate what about you agreed that if I had to distill the protocol into one thing it'd be eat further away from bedtime like that is then I'm one thing for me that would impact my resting heart rate so yeah totally agree and that's just anecdotal data like I've tried also like Brian know as many experiments but definitely he said this and I was like I don't know about that because I would be someone who doesn't have breakfast and so I'd push a food later and later but then yeah it really does the data reflects it I can like with with the eating part like I've gotten to the point now where if something happens and I don't get to eat dinner by certain time I just don't eat dinner yeah just at that point it becomes late enough that like the solution is to skip dinner as opposed to eating late like that's yeah yeah I 100% agree there's there's not a worse feeling for me than having eaten late and going to bed with a full stomach and having my resting heart rate in like the mid 50s it I just I feel the pain of the entire next day in my head hurts I'm tired I'm fatigued my emotions are you know I'm much more sensitive yeah so I agree I would rather not eat all right so yeah the next thing is a one-down routine that I do where I break myself out into various versions of Brian's I figured this out several years ago when I was working on my eating disorder and you know I'd overeat every night at 7 pm and I couldn't stop myself from doing so and so I tried everything nothing worked and the only thing that worked is I gave that version of me evening Brian a name and identified who he is what his emotional state is the problem he's dealing with in life and the arguments he uses to say like was to the thing so evening Brian we show up to duty at 7 pm having fed the kids, bade the kids put them to bed you know told them stories and then he's like dead like the stress of life is just wiped him out he wants to be like an apostle and just lay in the floor and play dead like it's too much and the only thing he can do to soothe his pain of life is to eat food and so you know brownies, graham crackers like whatever's in the kitchen like just devouring the whole thing and then that process of not being able to sleep and feeling gale and shame and then you know overweight and so evening Brian is has a lot in his plate he's very stressed he is bearing the weight of the world and he comes on to duty when other Brian's just spent all the willpower and so I basically just made a rule and I said evening Brian cannot eat food ever so from 5 pm to 10 pm which is the highest risk zone he cannot eat food no matter what because you can't negotiate with evening Brian he's not going to like be reasonable he just wants his his objective to be mat of eating food and so that rule really helps and so I started doing that with other Brian's that wrecked my sleep and so evening Brian is now in check he can't eat in those in those time windows so now I know that there's an anxious Brian and ambitious Brian and father and dad Brian and so I gave all myself all these different names and I articulated the characteristics of each version so like for example ambitious Brian is a is a very dominant very prominent character in my life so the the moment 7 30 pm comes my wine number teen is meant to start screens off and trying to call myself down ambitious Brian is the first person to show up and he's always like I have a brand new idea how we're going to make don't die into the most you know influential ideology in the world and the human race is going to survive this moment AI and sleep Brian has to say ambitious Brian we love you you're really doing a great job in life like good job keep it up also right now we're preparing for sleep so we're going to write down your idea then tomorrow we're going to then you know look at this idea because it sounds really promising let's think about it but I have to systematically go through this process and I have to talk to anxious Brian anxious Brian's like hey today in the podcast you said that thing you sounded really dumb like people probably like you know hit you up in the comments about the idiocy of what your statement was and so I have to say all right evening Brian thank you for the comment I'm going to like address this so that really helps me because otherwise what happens if you don't address these various challenges you have within your mind before bed your head his appeal and then you just loop through all these thoughts because they're not reconciled you're thinking about work and family and relationships what you're mad about and how you've been wronged and like all these things and then you if you do find they go to sleep you get an hour to a sleep you wake up and you're looping again so now the entire night you're in this light sleep you wake up the next day you're stressed you're worn down you're not well rested and you're in the same bad spot so this one hour routine you have to be off your phone and also walk yourself down off the anxieties of the day and calm yourself down and so people can do other things you know you can again you can take your own night time routine but to me that really works and right before like 10 minutes before bed I'll just hold a book in my hand and do that for like 10 minutes before I go to sleep it works so well screen off talk through the things book and it just creates a a great night sleep awesome so don't eat and then do everything in your power to calm your body down in preparation for beds that you're resting heart rate as low as possible is that a decent summary yeah and they quickly two other things is you want to avoid blue light so turn off uh you want to use red light and amber light avoid blue so screens off or if you do have screens on turn the red lights there's a great app called flux f dot l u x that knocks off blue on your on your screens and you can change your red mode on your on your mobile phones iOS or android and then um consistency so giving your body a consistent bedtime also gives your your um it lowers your resting heart rate because you're doing the same patterns every single day and the body gets to fall into a routine so if you make sleep your top priority and you know by by default resting heart rate it really is the is the single highest value thing you can do for your health consistency is is under appreciated as an important tool as well I would say um and then just a couple of other things uh that I've seen work a lot for people journaling um bath or some people sauna um there's there's other things that other tools you can use um in your tool belt for creating that um that routine but the consistency not only in the bedtime but also in the routine is super important okay and then watch the people target so you know I'm a 29 year old female is that the same as Brian what are the targets that people should opt for for optimal resting heart rate so if we look at the data the the target for the best longevity is less than 65 and how far less than 65 is going to depend depend up good bit on mostly your um your athletic prowess right so how how physically fit you are less than 65 is the bottom of the the curve in terms of longevity so that's where you have the best impact but some people are you know healthy at 40 or 38 for professional athletes uh but generally I would say a good a good spot to aim for in terms of overall physical fitness and for longevity would be in that load 50s women are going to be on average about two beats per minute higher than men so not a huge difference wow that's what I was going to go yeah slightly a bit of your event does it rise with age you're resting heart rate it rises but uh it's mostly due less to aging and more due to the loss of fitness so as we age many of us those are fitness and the the predominant effect is a um fitness loss causing the the increasing nursing heart rate that's awesome and Brian what did you say your resting heart rate is we'll make that alcohol 50 right now it yeah it's a bit higher it was around 46 before uh that was for the the nighttime rest it's now 50 I increased calories recently a little bit and also I exercise a ton so those two things increase the rest of your heart rate a little bit but some are between 46 and 50s where I've hovered for the past couple years yeah I will say when you are really in a caloric deficit I felt like your entire you will like your before bed it was like you were so steady and slow and like very it felt like you were already so calm heading into into sleep so that doesn't surprise me yeah you know I I love caloric restriction so much I mean when I was doing I see 1,900 calories a day they're about so I was like a 25% restriction um I got way too skinny and so I had to back off but I love that state my resting heart rate is incredibly low I feel very high energy so yeah actually I find that like as I have boosted calories it has some kind of um drawdown on my like heightened experience so yeah I really love to be at the lower end of caloric intake I think it really helps and I all my sleep stats for the past 12 months I've averaged eight hours and 35 minutes per night that's 94% sleep efficiency three hours and 54 minutes average of restorative sleep that's rim and deep my recovery is 69% and my HIV is 48 so on my HIV is average for my age the other metrics looked at an analysis for me and I'm on some of the metrics I forget I don't have the data in front of me now but it was like the 90th 98 99th percentile in some area I forget the actual numbers but yeah definitely it's a lead level sleep performance awesome all right you guys so the takeaways for folks exercise earlier in the day and then make resting heart rate your number one priority in life Brian likes being hungry and what are you saying Brian likes being hungry yeah Brian you can't go to go back to that intensive of caloric resharsion I mean the the main problem is when I lost so much weight I my face got really frail you know I got you have a skinny and people associate really skinny faces with old and whereas you know they associate fat faces with young and so I learned the hard way that when you lose a lot of fat in your face it's really hard to get back with the hardest thing to do and so yeah I wish I could I wish I could be caloric restricted and still have this sufficient fat where it wouldn't ding the project because people like I would try to see like but look at my markers like I'm you know healthy but they'd like you look like a skeleton how do I believe you so like what are you doing that situation yeah it's the entry price to have the conversation about health ironically yeah like unless you've got fat in your face it's very hard to have a conversation about health like you can't talk about your heart or your lungs your liver your pain criss because people they can't it doesn't pass their eye their their eye filters like kind of trust this conversation I mean like what do you make of that I mean I think we're all we're all human so it's natural to natural to have this stereotype it's just like just like I think it can be hard to listen to a physician who's overweight you know how do you take their advice seriously I think similar similar sort of issue it's hard to get pass our own stereotypes when we're in our own intuition yeah what's interesting is like it's probably a bias that's been built because folks that aren't eating enough probably aren't getting enough nutrition so like the correlation between like super super skinny and like bone mineral density for example it's probably like typically in the past I'm a great correlation so these intuitions are evolutionary and they're they're gonna be hard to fight yeah yeah just to make this obvious is um if you treat your resting heart rate as your accountability partner then it's really a beneficial thing for you so for example when you're on your couch at night it's an hour before bed and you fill the munchies and you think what do I have in my closet you know in the pantry that I can just do one or two bites of in that moment it's a high risk situation because if you do that you're not going to have one or two bites you're gonna probably have the whole bag and then a whole you know pint of ice cream or like whatever like it's got a lead to more debatuous behavior that of course is gonna have these really negative effects and so if you can keep in your mind and say if I eat even one chip or like one spoon full of whatever my resting heart rate is going to increase and that is going to be the accountability where like now I've you know I've messed this process up and so it is your best friend I wish I could actually have I wish I could have a dashboard of my best friends in life and see their resting heart rate overnight and then be able to call them and say like hey my cake cake I see your resting heart rates up 7% how are you doing how how did you and I go you know like it's it's such an important indicator of someone's well being I wish I could do that and call all my friends all the time and say how how's it going like kind of help on something we're just not doing that I mean we mean Kate Kate and I share that data like every single day like we will just send each of the screenshots of like certain numbers and we both know it tells like a thousand word story I know everything behind the entire thing that happened it tells me her emotional state it tells me what she's going to be like working today it tells me like what's a prioritize and what to deprioritize it's amazing how much information we've been able to capture in these these very small data points yeah it's true yeah hey Mike does does your family follow this do they adhere to these kinds of principles or is this something you do yourself or do your children kind of have their different routines we we're here to these principles I mean like globally in terms of overall overall health and I time routine all those things yeah we do we do it here to those principles the children yeah like screens are off but well before bed and my wife's the same way yeah we've just found it works and I think everybody's committed to it okay you guys all right thanks thank you all"}
