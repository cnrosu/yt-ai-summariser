I am using Lightning Conductor and I'm gonna change it to this one Now what you're gonna do is using Val orb on these keep using it until you get one plus one as you can see I got plus one level from Corruption from the first skill Now what I'm gonna do is I need to put this skill here Okay, I need to put it as one of my skills now I will go back to the stash and upgrade this skill to higher level So 20 gem. Okay, this is level 19. As you can see now I upgraded from level 17 to level 19 So after upgrade now notice that this corrupted gem is level 19 and I got one more level from Corruption So notice now this is my cost to chop damage at this point is only 50,000 now what I'm gonna do is getting this one and Add it here. Okay now notice the damage increases to 56,000. This is a new 6,000 more damage"}
