The story saying that the company potentially working closer with the US government on sharing data across agencies so they're talking about the IRS and about other agencies within the government potentially part of that push. Behind the scenes officials have quietly put technological building blocks into place to enable his plan, in particular they've turned to one company. Palantir and other AI-focused defense tech firms are among the minority of federal contractors who are thriving under the second Trump administration. Of a tech realignment that is taking shape, Apple and other mega-cap school go-mata Amazon, they're on the outs in terms of political favor, making way for a new class of Washington-friendly tech companies and they're caching in on a new era of hard power AI. The Department of Government Efficiency, until recently under the leadership of Elon Musk, has aggressively targeted what it calls wasteful spending, canceling thousands of federal contracts and triggering significant layoffs. Meanwhile, Palantir's stock has surged since the 2024 election as its entrenchment into government operations deepens. I don't know that most Americans think they interact with Palantir on a daily basis. I think I'm going to just give it a rough guess here. All Americans interact with Palantir on a daily basis. The company could be nudged into too big to fail status thanks to the White House's focus on next-generation technologies. President Trump has proposed a defense budget for fiscal 2026 exceeding $1 trillion, a 13% increase over the previous year. We are revitalizing our defense, industrial, bases and reallocating resources toward the most lethal and effective capabilities. Palantir's fingerprints are all over high-profile defense projects like the Golden Dome Missile Defense System. The project may have an AI-powered battlefield intelligence platform, and the revamped Ivo's Combat Goggles project through its partnership with Endural Industries. The company maintains tight support among today's tech giants, whose attitudes regarding defense contracts have shifted dramatically since last year. There's likely no defense-related tech project Palantir isn't involved in to some extent. The part I love is that we're winning, the part I love almost more is that we're getting to do our usual humiliate the critics of Palantir and it makes my life a lot of fun. Now worth over 310 billion, Palantir emerged in the aftermath of 9-11. A. Palco founder Peter Teal, Alex Carp and others launched the firm in Palo Alto in 2004, with its mission-helping governments find patterns in big data to stop crime and terrorism. Over the last two decades, Palantir has been expanding its footprint across intelligence, defense, national security, and law enforcement agencies. Its software has been credited with helping the U.S. track terrorists uncover criminal networks and track down Osama bin Laden. Palantir has long enjoyed bipartisan support with little awareness outside of Washington. As its influence expands under the Trump administration, resistance is growing. Broome, I hope we're here to serve the American people and my version of service is the soldiers are happier, the enemies are scared, and Americans go back to enjoying the fact that we're the only one with a real tech scene in this country and we're going to win everything. The data initiative would extend the defense tech giants reach into the U.S. federal government's civilian data infrastructure, including the IRS and Social Security Administration. According to reports, the Trump administration has tasked Palantir with consolidating data sets into a centralized system for advanced analytics and predictive modeling. Powered by Palantir's Gotham software, the platform uses AI to identify anomalies and patterns indicative of illegal activities or security threats. The name of Palantir's flagship software platform is inspired by New York City's nickname. Washington Irving popularized the term in the early 19th century, but today it's mostly associated with Gotham City from the DC Universe. In either case, Gotham is a place where darkness hides in plain sight and powerful tools are needed to bring order to chaos. Palantir introduced the software in 2008. The same year, the Dark Knight hit theaters and became a global cultural phenomenon. The Christopher Nolan film depicts a surveillance system that's strikingly similar to Palantir's Gotham platform. Bruce Wayne, portrayed by Christian Bale, creates a secret wide-scale sonar surveillance system that taps into every cell phone in Gotham City. Morgan Freeman, as Lucius Fox, is shocked by the supercomputer's ethical implications and warns that no man should have this much power. 2008 also saw the release of the Techno Thriller Eagle Eye, which centers around an AI-driven surveillance and threat prediction system. The Gotham platform is essentially an early version of the fictional system in the film called Aria, which monitors real-time data from phones, cameras, emails, and government databases to detect threats. Palantir Gotham provides those who protect our values, with a technology to make decisions at speed, and in the process makes the world a safer place. In the real world, Palantir's Gotham platform centralizes information from disparate sources like police databases, immigration systems, military systems, and public records. It turns the raw information into easy to understand charts, maps, timelines, and relationship networks so users can spot patterns quickly. Gotham matches unstructured data from intelligence reports, surveillance video, and drone footage, phone and text message logs, social media content, PDFs, and other documents with structured data to uncover hidden connections. Palantir's stock experience is significant increase when news broke about the potential contract. Financial details have not been publicly disclosed, but the scale of the project suggests a substantial investment. The integration of extensive personal data across multiple federal agencies has set off alarms among civil liberties groups. Critics argue that this centralized nature of the platform could lead to overreach and misuse. In response to criticisms, Palantir has said it's committed to upholding privacy and civil liberties. Speaking of Eagle Eye, that's the name of the new system that Enduro Industries and Meta are joining forces to build to enhance situational awareness for soldiers on the battlefield. The collaboration reunites Enduro founder Palmer Lucky with Mark Zuckerberg after the suspected robots company famously fired the Oculus founder for his support for the Maga movement back in 2016. It's part of the broader $22 billion program that Enduro took over from Microsoft earlier this year. They're developing next generation smart glasses designed for military applications. It's not just a head-not-a-display. It's a fully integrated ballistic shell with hearing protection, vision protection, head protection, onboard compute, onboard networking, your radios, and what we're doing is working with Meta to take the building blocks that they've invested enormous amounts of money and expertise in and were able to use those building blocks in Eagle Eye without having to recreate them from scratch ourselves. The devices will be manufactured at Enduro's new massive plant in Ohio called Arsenal One, which is the largest US defense manufacturing facility in decades.
