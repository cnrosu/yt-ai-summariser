{"video_id": "JpsBPHhV9fs", "transcript": " What's happening beautiful people, it's Corpius and welcome back to another Path of Exile 2 Endgame guide. Finally, we managed to get the Amazon Lightning Spear finalized and ready for this guide. This is what we had to go through. But this is what we actually ended up building. To achieve that result, I literally had to test every single variation that was coming my way on stream. It doesn't matter, but we managed to make it happen. I know a lot of you guys have been waiting for it. So without any further ado, do the basic stuff like like this video if it helped you out or subscribe to the channel. It really helps me grow and don't forget to come and say hi over on twitch.tv says Corpius underscore ENT. Alright, we said the thing. Okay, so this is my final late endgame guide for the Amazon Lightning Spear. We've got a lot of stuff to cover. So before I do that, I just want to make sure that you guys are following the right thing. So if you're still leveling or you don't have an Amazon, don't follow this guide. What you want to do is check the description down below. I'm going to have a leveling guide link or you can find it here on the notes. If you go all the way down, it's going to be right here. The first one is the early endgame guide and the other one is the leveling guide. First thing here, we're going to take everything in order. We have purity of fire. We don't use this ability. This is not an ability that we're going to use in combat. We just have it because of our scepter. You all know the chicken leg unique. Obviously, this is the most popular item most probably now in this season. And it's the sacred flame shrine scepter, which is almost mandatory to have in this variation of the build. It gives you insane amount of damage. We don't care about the ability. What we care is about the free slots that it has for you to put your support gems. And on the hush hush, we don't need to announce it to everybody. But purity of fire doesn't actually reserve spirit. So you can put all the spirit gems that you want here and it's not going to affect your spirit. So use it while we have it available. So what we're going to put here is clarity. Number one, obviously for mana region, we've got vitality for that extra 1% maximum life per second, which is really good. Then we have precision for the 30% accuracy rating because it's going to give us some more extra speed due to our passive tree. And lastly, we go with cannibalism. Moving on, we've got spear stab. You're going to start your boss encounter with spear stab so you can get some charges and then simply bombard them with stormlands and have the stormlands activate its frenzy charge usage so we can actually explode and deal even more damage. And the support gems are one on this is concentrated effect. Obviously, we don't care about the area of effect. We care about the area damage. Then next, we've got lightning penetration because whenever you start encounter, you're going to stab them. 30% less lightning resistance means more damage for us. Then we've got close combat. Obviously, 25% more attack damage, elemental focus for 25% more elemental damage, and embeder, which will gain extra damage of any type other than cold. So we have lightning and we deal some fire damage as well. Scepter, right? So this is pretty good, embeder. Next, we've got spear throw. This to be completely honest, you could just have it there as decoration. I don't usually use it, but it's like free, so I just tap it there and whatever happens happens. So the support gems you can put on this to make it a little bit better if you want to use this is long shot for the distance. We've got ambush for the crit. We've got rising tempest and we've got ricochet. Lightning spear, the main ability. Obviously, we have vault. We have martial tempo now. And actually, martial tempo is prone to be a really good gem. And I underestimated it early and mid, whenever I tried it before, I underestimated it a little bit. But it helps a lot because we got to the point where we're reducing the maps so much that the map density of the mobs and their speed and everything was very frustrating because whenever you move, you build your Voltaic charges through vault, right? And if you get hit, then two things activate. Number one, your Held of Thunder. Number two, your Wind Dancer, which means that everybody's knocked back. Your Held of Thunder hits, which means your Voltaic charges are lost. So if I don't have the martial tempo, I'm not quick enough to throw the spear to impact the entire screen. So martial tempo is not bad here. Okay, then we have perpetual charge, 35% chance to not remove the charges, which is really good. Next, we've got fork is one of the old support gems that I still have in here. I did a little bit of testing with different kinds of support gems. We're going to get to that in a second, whenever we check my notes down below. But fork is really good for this build. And lastly, we've got primal armament, 25% more weapon elemental damage. Then we've got Stormlands, which is our main bus killer. In this right now, we've got blind side because we're going to run blind on infused weapon. So blind side is going to help us deal more critical damage. We've got bullseye for 50% more accuracy rating. We've got deliberation for 20% more damage. Then we've got execute for 50% more damage with hits against enemies that are low on life. They get to a 30% range of their health. And I don't even notice when they die. They just die. And the last one is overextend with a critical strike. Whenever it dazes us, it doesn't harm you in any way. So you just gain more critical damage bonus. Next, we've got barrage. We've got our super ability. I spam this ability like there's no tomorrow. Doesn't matter if I'm mapping, I always use barrage before my lightning spear if I can. Or I always use barrage with my Stormlands on buses if I can. Try and spam this as much as you can on cooldown. And the support gems on barrage, we've got primeditation for 15% more damage with that skill. We've got murderous intent so we can have the calling strike, which is insanely good for anybody who doesn't know calling strike is. What it does, it kills normal enemies if their life is at 30% or below. Magic enemies are at 20%, rare's are at 10% and unique's are at 5%. Which means calling strike with execute on Stormlands, pretty decent combo there. We've got inhibitor, which is a must if you want this to be working normally. You're gonna get 4% more damage per different type of charge that we have. Then we've got ingenuity of course 30% less cooldown on barrage. And finally we've got twofold benefits from consuming charges for supported skill have 20% chance to be doubled. If you think about it, barrage you're using it on buses and on mapping. So I think twofold is so much better on barrage than any other individual ability. Next up we've got another boss specific ability, orb of storms. We all know what orb of storms does, you put the orb, it starts chaining, it deals a lot of damage. And the support gems we want on here is pin point critical, 60% more critical hit chance, 30% less critical damage bonus which is fine. Then we have inevitable critical for 25% increase critical hit. Then we have font of rage, which whenever you're close to the orb of storm, you're gonna start gaining rage. And the more rage you have, the more damage you deal. So this is really good. And lastly we've got persistence for 40% more skill effect duration. Now if you're rich or you are lucky enough to have spare perfect jewelers or if you want to slap this, you can go with things like font of mana. For example, if you're struggling with mana, just saying next we've got infused weapon here, which it simply empowers our abilities and empowers us in general. It's an automatic aura that just exists there. And the reason why we have this is this beautiful node right here elemental infusion, which is part of the ascendancy. On infused weapon, what we want to put now is blind. Once again, for obviously stormlands is blindside to work, then we need conduction, 100% more shock chance. Then we have stripper way for 20% increase the effect of the exposure. Then we have calling strike again, which is gonna help us with the rares and everything else. And lastly we have lightning exposure for stripper way to be able to actually do its thing. Next or as obviously Harold of Thunder, one of the basic ones, I'm not gonna explain what it does, but the support gems that we have now are things like innovate, which is pretty mandatory. Attacks again, 35% of damage is lightning damage. Really, really good if you're killing shocked enemies. Then we've got electrocute and neural overlord. These are the ones that help you whenever you're doing mapping for combat frenzy to build electrocution and give you your charges for your lightning spear to be able to clear the entire screen. Then we have deadly Harold, 30% more damage on Harold of Thunder. And lastly we've got reach for that 80% less accuracy. It's fine, but we have 35% more area of effect. Next we've got combat frenzy. The only thing we'll care about this is with profusion, 50% chance to grant an additional charge. But don't forget that both Harold of Thunder and combat frenzy are absolutely useless when it comes down to bosses. So whenever you don't bossing, you can turn them off if you want to do something else. But if you're running this build with the gear and you just follow through this, you're not gonna need anything else. I always have them on, as I said before. I don't actually want to do any manual work when it comes down to my abilities. But moving on, we've got an aura that's dedicated to bossing and it's actually pretty useless for mapping this time around. So it's cast on critical. Cast on critical is the most expensive aura that we have. Its reservation is at 100 spirit, which is pretty insane. If you think about it, the reason why it's 100 spirit is because it's not a normal aura. It's a meta aura that triggers a spell. And the spell we're gonna go for is sniper's mark like before. For anybody who's confused with snipers mark what it does, it finds the target, places the mark. The next time you deal damage with a critical hit, you're gonna consume that mark, deal more damage with that critical hit, but also get yourself a charge. Which means that it's used this for mapping because by the time the mark hits the target, the entire screen is dead with light and spear. So you don't really care about it. But for bosses is very good because cast on critical is gonna try and spam the bosses with this mark. And we're actually building critical hit chance for that exact reason that the more we have, the faster we're gonna be consuming charges, the faster we consume charges, the more damage that we deal. The supportions we want here is energy retention. We've got inspiration, 30% less cost, and then impetus for 40% increased energy. The last two that we have here are the defensive nodes. The most important out of the two is definitely wind dancers. Probably my favorite aura when it comes down to defense. We've got main for the extra CC. We've got arms length for the 40% more knockback duration. Next we've got energy barrier, which is really good because it adds into the energy shield build that we're actually doing here. And lastly we've got pin for the extra CC as well. Lastly here we've got ghost dance, which is not bad to run, but this is one of the spells that we currently have that you are free to remove to put something else if you want. But do make sure that you have decent gear to get to the point where you can afford to lose ghost dance. The support gem you can put on this is fast forward and that's basically it. Now the abilities are set. The rotation. Does it change a tiny bit only for bossing? Mapping, you just run around, you just spam lightning spear and you're good to go. On bossing things are a little bit different. What you want to do is you want to set up orb of storms, get close and personal, stab him real quick, like two, three times until you get like two charges. Whenever you do that, then you simply barrage, you storm lands, and then you spam storm lands, and you just use barrage on cooldown. If you have some leeway to go back and just quickly, sneak the stab him again for a couple of charges, you could do that as well. But that's the rotation. That's all you got to do. Alright, next up, let's look at my gear. So first things first, as I said, the scepter. Sacred Flame is really good because it gives you anywhere between 50, 60% extra fire damage, which simply means that you get like 50 or 60 extra damage, which is really, really good. It gives you spirit as well as you can see. This one has 132 spirit. Apart from that, it does have a socket that you can add stuff in. And what you could go for is rabbit talisman, which gives you 10% increased spirit, which helps a lot with running multiple different stuff and having more spirit. But it's really rare and it's really expensive. So good luck with that. But yeah, rabbit talisman is good. Otherwise, if you can order for that or you can't find it, you can put literally anything else that you think that it could be good. Like stuff like critical damage bonus, for example, or critical hit or life regen. Completely up to you. Next, we've got the most popular spear in this season, Tangletong and what you want to look for is ideally two sockets if you can. And you see this little mold right here, the critical hit chance. You definitely want to try and get it as close to 20 or even surpass 20 if you can afford it. It's going to be very expensive if you go above 20. But the higher it is, the better the spear is going to be. Anything below 18 is considered as meh. So just be careful whenever you're buying it. And regarding the sockets, what you want to add there is additional critical damage bonus. We are not running penetrate for anybody who doesn't know what penetrate does. It gives you 25% more damage based on the accuracy of your weapon. And since we're not running a sea glass spear with like 700 accuracy, I don't think it's worth getting this. If you want to add accuracy in these runes, that's why we're going for the extra critical. But that's what the Tangletong. Next unique that we have here is the beacon of aziz solar amulet. You can definitely go with the rare if you want to and look for things like attributes and resistances and plus levels of projectiles. It's going to increase your damage 100%. The reason why we go with beacon of aziz and you might want to switch into it as well is A, it gives you pretty decent spirit. B, it gives you critical hits, ignore enemy monster elemental resistances. Really, really good for bossing especially, but also for mapping. We tested it with maps and it's so, so good. However, there's a little twist to this. You definitely want to make sure that your critical hit chance is as high as possible before you go to this. If you go critical hit chance at 50%, 60%, running this, probably half of the time you're not even going to be hitting the critical hits that it's necessary for this malto work. So definitely make sure that you have your critical hit chance around 80 or even more than that. And then go for beacon of aziz, you're going to see an insane increase of damage when it comes down to the bosses. We know all know what ingenuity belt does, the higher the percentage there, the better. However, you can also run hit hunters for mapping. The last unique that I currently have right now is the Ascensha Sanguis furtive wraps, which is the main unique that every single person has been asking me about on stream. The reason why this is good is A, it gives us evasion and energy shield and we're building hybrid, which you're going to see in a second. It also gives us decent flat lightning damage, decent intelligence that we can use for our attribute stuff and lightning resistance. But the most important reason why we have this unique is life leech is converted to energy shield leech, which means that every single time that you deal damage and you're leaching from the enemies, you will be able to restore your energy shield. Beautiful stuff. However, for this to work, you need two different things. Without those two things, this is going to be completely useless. Thing number one is going for at least one of your two rings to have leaching on its mods. And the thing number two, mystic harvest. Life leech recovers based on your elemental damage as well as physical damage. We focus on energy shield on the boots. We focus on energy shield on the helmet and we focus on hybrid version of the chest with evasion and energy shield. So as you can see, these three are going to cover my attribute and my resistance requirements as well as feed me as much defensive capability and layering as possible. So getting into the passive skill tree, what you're going to notice first is the ascendancy. Obviously, we covered two out of the four points here. But obviously, we're going with critical strike for that 100% exceeding and the 25% of the excess chance to hit with attacks as well. We're going for predatory instinct, which is going to reveal the weaknesses, going to make our life with the rares and the bosses and unique bosses a lot easier. And then the other two that we covered, this one for infused weapons. So we can give us more damage when it comes down to our weapon skills. And then the last one is the life leaching mystic harvest. If you're not going for the leaching build and you want to swap it out a little bit, you can drop this and extend here for infused avatar. If, however, you don't want the leach one, but you also don't want the Tangletongue and you go for a C glass with more accuracy, you drop this and you simply go for penetrate. The important stuff, however, is the remaining of the passive tree. As you can see, we go a straight line over here with blur, the obvious stuff we have with the normal passive tree. We're going to get escape velocity. We're going to get some elemental damage right here with catalysis, our heralds, obviously. We're going to get the falcon dive. We need that for the speed. That's why we also put some accuracy on the support gems. We're going to get all the crit notes here, but don't forget that we need critical hit chance. You need to build the hit chance more than the damage bonus at the moment. If you're going to be running my build right here, we need your critical hit chance to get us close to 100% as possible. Another good notes here are obviously spectral ward. We have the critical stuff and we're going to scale all the way up here for patient barrier for 60% more energy shield, which is what I was telling you guys before, which is going to make us even tanker. You guys saw me without this and I was around 3k energy shield and then we put this on top is going to go to almost double. It's really, really good. For the weapon set one, we have some very dedicated stuff, but also some random. You don't need to do exactly what I did. For example, here I just did the extension on the crit notes. We got the wild storm right here and we have the entire spear cluster. For the weapon set two, personally, I don't really use it. I just use these random weapons speed stuff here so I can be able to match it with weapon set one. But that's basically it when it comes down to passive skill tree. Now, the jewels are also very, very important. We've got things like maximum energy shield. You want to maximize as much as you can because again, damage is good. You don't have an issue with damage on mapping. You will eventually become really, really good with bolsing as well. But one thing you'd be struggling consistently is how squishy or tanky you are. So make sure that you get yourself some energy shield. We've got even more critical hit, critical damage and elemental damage here. So the majority of these sapphires is going to be very, very similar to each other. Good mods here are elemental damage, projectile damage are good as well. Area of effect is really good because area of effect is going to make your lightning spear blast even further, not bad stuff. Then we have things like maximum mana on kill if you have an issue with mana. And lastly, we have an emerald that's really good to combine a couple of these things I just said together. And lastly here, I think it's very, very crucial for me to answer some of your most frequently asked question. And let's begin with the anointments. Subterfuge is a really, really good one, especially if you have a good helmet with a lot of energy shield. It's a good and a cheap option that you can start with. If you want something better, you can go with patient barrier. 60% maximum energy shield is really good to bolsting your defenses. But again, we're going to be having towards it. So eventually at some point you will want to change it. Personally, I changed it a little bit earlier because I'm still safe with 2.5 energy shield. And I went for overwhelming strike, which is insane for damage. Now, jewels, when it comes down to jewels, a lot of people are asking me for prism of belief. Prism of belief is not bad. What it does, it gives one to three levels to any skill that you choose. You can choose lightning spear, you get plus three on lightning spear. Is it good? It probably will deal a lot of damage. Is it worth the divine though? I don't think so because you're already an amazing mapper. There's no reason to invest your divine that will make something being 9 out of 10 to make it be 10 out of 10. You can also choose to go plus three on stormlands, which is going to increase your damage on bosses. That could be a very good call, but again, the divine that you're going to use for that, you can actually go for a better jewel than what you already have. And lastly, we have the ability to return it. I actually tried every single version that you guys recommended and what I found to be pretty popular. So here's my opinion about things. So if you, in case you want to do something else, then what I did, Roamount is pretty fun. It gives you some extra movement speed and you can clear things a little bit easier. But bossing is pretty horrible. And if you get stunned while mapping, you risk dying. Next, I've tried Blastfamy with temporal chains on similar crumb content. And it's actually best, I believe. If you guys are too lazy to swap it around, don't worry about it. You can still do similar crumb without Blastfamy and temporal chains. But if you struggling a little bit, then Blastfamy and temporal chains is beautiful on similar crumb content. Because it just slows everything down and you have time to react and kill stuff. Next, we've got Primal Strikes. Primal Strikes is very cool. It's a new little trendy thing that goes on. It's a melee ability that deals a lot of damage. And it's a really, really good alternative to stormlands when it comes down to bosses. Next, we have conductivity, the nice little curse that you put on the target and minimizes the lightning resistance. We were doing the early version of this build with this ability. Absolutely love it. I think it's really good. But eventually you get like things like the beacon of a ziz. You get a couple of other things that you don't really need conductivity. But it's a solid ability if you have issues with the boss's still with jewels, passive notes. And none of that that you can afford. Conductivity is pretty good. Then something very, very interesting with lightning spear. Instead of using fork, I started using gamble shot for fun. Somebody suggested it on stream. And I started using this. And actually it's not bad. For anybody who doesn't know what it does, it has a chance of rolling fork, chain and pierce an additional time. And if you're lucky enough, it can actually roll two or three of those three things. So you can get a chain and a fork or a fork and a pierce or all three at the same time, which makes it very, very fun. Personally, however, I do feel that fork is more consistent. But you can have fun with gamble shot as well. It's a really good alternative. The other two, you probably cannot see them because I'm in the way. But the one is blink. I think it's pretty obvious. You can put in your weapon set too if you have the space. Pretty decent movement. I don't use it. I don't need it. I prefer stuff without moving them around, as I said before. And last but not least, we've got tamed beast. You can go with that. If you like that feature and having like a pet with you, the aura you can go with is haste, haste. But again, I don't like swapping stuff around. So I don't use tamed beast, but that's basically it. And that should cover everything about the lightning spear.
