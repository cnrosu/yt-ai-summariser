{"video_id": "QwCD1_imKhA", "transcript": " If you want to start doing 10 times more damage in Path of Exile 2, there's a few simple steps that you can follow, regardless of your build, regardless of your class, there's some key things that you can do to push your damage to that next level. Let's get into it. Hey everyone, Entash here, and today I want to talk about pushing up your damage to the millions. I want to explain why your sheet DPS is wrong and nothing representative above how much damage you're actually doing. I want to talk about cast speed and attack speed and why it is utterly broken in this game, and I want to talk about ways that you can build your character to do 10 times more damage. It doesn't matter if you're casting spells, it doesn't matter if you're a bow user, this applies to absolutely everyone. I want to talk about a few rules that you need to follow in order to do this, let's get started. Really quickly, if I'm talking about this staff and talking about the spell damage, equate that to physical damage or elemental damage on your item if you're a ranger or a melee unit. If I'm talking about something like cast speed, that is attack speed. How quickly you can do your animations and get damage out on field. But for the most part, everything I say here is just one to one, follow this, you're going to have a godly build. So your sheet DPS is completely wrong. It is not even close to the actual damage that you're doing because it doesn't take into account multiple things. My spark is moving around the map, and the faster that it moves, the more targets can get hit with one spark. So something like acceleration is giving me more chances to hit multiple targets with one cast. It also has extended duration, 40% more, and so the longer it's on field and doing damage, that is giving me more damage multiplier and value. But it's not shown anywhere in the DPS. But one of the biggest and most important things you can do is your cast and your attack speed, because every multiplier that you have is being multiplied by these numbers. The other big one is the level of your skills because it's going to be boosting up the base damage that everything is multiplying off of. Okay? And so the goal here is to get as much attack or cast speed that we can sustain and actually keep casting and not lose all of our mana. The next thing is get the highest skill points that you can to once again not completely run out of mana and also not die while doing it and have some decent resistances. So I want to talk about all these things today and how we're actually going to do it and not break the bank to do it. So rule number one is if you're dead, you're not doing damage. Okay? And so we want to get our resistances up as high as the cap possible. We want to get to the 75 and everything if you can. And once you are at 75 and everything, if you've got room, you can start removing damage. So if we look at this cold resistance here, I am well over capped. I have too much cold resistance. If I can drop my cold resistance down for damage, this is an opportunity to do it as long as I'm not neutering some of my other resistances and survivability like my energy shield. Okay? And so I've got a really good example of that right now with this ring. This ring is pretty similar to my other one except look at the bottom ring there. It's got very similar mana. It's got increased elemental resistances, but instead of having cold resistance, I've got increased cast speed. And so we look at our spark DPS of 47, excuse me, 47,000. If I just equip this ring, we're jumping up to 53,000 because the base damage is the same. I'm just doing it more often. Okay? And it's a very easy way to boost that damage. And so if I take that ring off, we're still capped on all of these different resistances. We actually got a little bit of chaos. And for the most part, our survivability is very, very similar. It might be a little bit different, but it's not the end of the world. And so in situations like that, that is how you're going to get more damage. Now I want to show you this as well. This is going to neuter my damage. So this, let me get that out of the way. This amulet is very good for survivability because it gives me the extra mana energy shield or whatever based on my mana. But hypothetically, if I was to replace this thing that has no damage on it for the most part, and I was to put on something like this that has spell damage and cast speed. You can see from 53,000 damage all the way up to 65,000. Now I wouldn't actually do this because I would die. I wouldn't be able to survive out there. But these things are where you're going to get a lot of damage. Amulets and rings are one of the biggest damage boosts that you can get because it's one of the only ways to get additional spell damage or attack damage or cast speed or attack speed on your gear. And so that is going to be kind of the first step is we need to get as many resistances on our pieces as we can. We want to get, you know, 35 resistance, 30 lightning resistance on some of these pieces. We want to get big hits of these things so that we can hopefully survive and live. All right. We want to make sure that those things are covered as a priority so that you can start filling in the damage elsewhere. Something like this belt here is covering me on half of the cold resistance and lightning resistances that I need. Okay. Now once you've done that and you've got your resistances and you're covered in your living, you can start pushing maps and getting more currency and playing the game properly. Because until then you're just going to get one shot. However, there is also the argument of if an enemy dies first, then I can't die. And so what I would recommend you do is get your resistances up first. Make sure that you're living doing things that are going to keep you alive. This one, you know, it's got elemental resistances, cold resistance, life mana. This thing is not as much damage. But in the case of this ring, it would have allowed me to cover a lot of my cold resistances and get me up and running and fighting sooner. So that's step number one. Now with your weapons, skill levels are very important and then things like physical damage or spell damage are very important. But one of the biggest things is cast speed, attack speed. Because the more often you can do those things, the more damage you're going to do. And it is a very exponential thing. If I get a little bit more lightning damage on this, let's say I got 10% more lightning damage, that is a tiny, tiny, tiny upgrade. If I was to get 10% more cast speed, that is a massive, massive upgrade. Because cast speed or attack speed is multiplying every other thing you have done and doing it more often. So I've got all this crit damage, all this electrical damage, all this base damage from this thing and I'm just doing it more often. And it is the biggest multiplier or one of the best multipliers in the game as long as you have the mana and resources to sustain it and not be running out. In the case of me, I can move around and I can cast these spells and I can essentially cast indefinitely without running out of mana. And if we look at something like this staff here, okay, this staff, really quickly, let me show you, this has plus seven levels to lightning spell skills. That's huge. It's actually more than my wand. This is plus four and this is plus two for a plus six. So this has a ton of lightning spell skills. It's got a crit damage multiplier. It's got 153 increased spell damage. It's got a lot of mana, which is impacting my arc mage. This is a really solid staff for the cost. But if I equip this into that same slot, my DPS drops down to 34% or to 34,000 from like 47,000. This is a massive downgrade. And one of the biggest reasons why is because of that cast speed. I am not doing the spell as often. I am not doing the attack as often. Even if I was to jump up and I was to give this thing 250% increased spell damage, I still wouldn't approach the levels of the wand and focus. And so that's just a quick demonstration of why you want to get attack or cast speed into your build to benefit from these things. Now the next big thing to boost up your damage is crit rate and crit damage because the more of them that you have, the more they snowball and make you OP. And when you start looking at your items, if you can fit that crit rate or crit damage into your build, you're going to go to the absolute moon on your damage. It might not show on the sheet DPS, but you will start melting bosses. The reason why is this is a more multiplier. Whatever your damage is, you are then multiplying it by your crit multiplier and doing exponentially more damage. If I was to boost up the spell damage on this thing and I was to give it 15% more spell damage, that is a tiny upgrade. If I was to give this thing 15% more critical spell damage bonus, that is a massive upgrade in comparison. It is probably two times stronger overall when you start taking and cast speed and all these other bonuses that are affecting me. It's only 15% but it is not the same value. With crit rate and crit damage, these things snowball on top of each other. And if you can get items that have both of them or you can get them multiple ways in your kit, in the case of me, I've got critical damage over here. There's more crit that I can unlock after I've leveled a bit more. I've got crit rate up here. These things snowball on top of each other and make you dominate everything that you're fighting. Now the next big thing that you need to do is start setting up your curses or your marks and we need to start talking about exposure, lightning exposure, fire exposure, all these different things. And I would very highly recommend in your kit, in your build, depending on where you're passing, if there's a way to do a weapon swap into curses, I would do it. So in the case of castors, it's very easy. I can do one tree up into damage and another tree into a cursteration and effect of my curses and things like that. The reason why is because once again, this is an exponential curve. If we look at something like my conductivity, this is minus 38% lightning resistance. But enemies can go into the negatives. And the more of this we get and stack with other things, the more damage we do on an exponential curve. And so minus 38% lightning resistance shred is good. But when you make it 25% better and 40% more better and we start shredding their defenses by 90% and you're putting them into the negative, you just quadrupled your overall damage. And there's multiple ways that you can do this. So on a caster, I can cast this curse, I can boost up these things. That is good. But the other thing you need to consider is the exposure exposure. So this is another thing that is shredding their defenses. So at a base, an exposure of lightning fire or ice will shred their defenses by minus 20%. But again, we can boost up the value of these exposures and make them more valuable. If we look at this one here, sorry, this one here, the exposure that you have is 30% more effective. Again, shredding it more. And if we look in our in our skill tree here and we go to this one here, 30% more effective lightning exposure. This is again another big multiplier. And so when you start cursing them and hitting them with this, all of a sudden their resistances are so negative that we are once again multiplying all of our previous damage on. It is kind of the trifecta critical damage. Hitting them with that cast speed or attack speed and then shredding their defenses. We get these three things and we go from pretty good damage to nuking entire screens and one shoting bosses. Now the next big thing is jewels. This is where you can get unbelievably big damage bonuses because they all add up and stack on each other and it gets crazy. So once again, you want things that are critical damage, attack or cast speed and things like that. And notice this also has elemental damage. That is the least valuable thing compared to the critical damage and cast speed. It's still really, really good. But you want to start looking for things that have double crit damage. This thing here with double crit damage is exceptionally powerful in comparison to the other one. Now if I could somehow get cast speed on this thing, it would be like utterly broken. But for the most part, the same rules apply. Speed or attack speed, critical chance, critical damage, those things are going to multiply on top of each other and be very, very strong. But again, there's other things in here that are very valuable. Now, it doesn't always have to be damage that you're getting from these jewels because this one here has increased cursteration that I got from a valorb, which is really cool. It also gives me mana on kill, which is really solid as well. And sometimes you value these things more than damage because they allow your build to function. Because you can't cast spells, you can't fight. And so there is a bit of a balance here on what you're going to do, but between your entire skill tree and all your gear, as long as you can cast, you can win. As long as you can fight back and live and knock at one shot, you can win. But if we can maximize our damage and start one-shotting everything else, well, you can sometimes start sacrificing a few of these survivability things to clear content quicker and essentially safer. It's very hard to die when nothing can get close to me. I don't even have to look at the screen and I could just slowly walk through the map like this and I would never die. Now, it's not the most fun playstyle, but hypothetically, I could do it. And so there are situations where if you're not fighting bosses at the end of the map or you're fighting some of the pinnacle bosses, more damage is survivability. Nothing can shoot me. Nothing can hit me. Nothing can get near me. There is a bit of a delicate balance while you are mapping where pushing up your damage is technically survivability. So it is something to consider if you want to give up a little bit of energy shield for 10% more damage. Now, this is only one side of the game. Instantly killing mobs like this is cool, but if I was to take this build in, I still have the potential of getting one shot by some of the pinnacle bosses. And so there's a bit of a balance that you're going to need to strike between the content that you are doing. But for the most part, this is the majority of the game. And you can respect into more survivability and things like that once you decide to go fight some of the pinnacle bosses. When you finally get one of those audience with the king and want to go fight the boss, you can go and try to get a little bit more survivability. But I will also make the counterpoint that if you learn a lot of the fights, many of the attacks are telegraphed. Many of the things are easy to dodge. And if you can kill the boss faster, there are less opportunities for the boss to one shot you. A really good example of that is the pinnacle boss for the, what is it, the bringer of ash? Let me show you really quickly what I'm talking about. So I've only done this fight a couple of times and I actually never saw the attack he's about to do. It's this big AOE and you have to stand in the little blue columns that are safe. And if you don't, you essentially get one shot. And with full shield, you know, essentially full mana, thousands and thousands of effective health, I got one shot. And so what is the point of having defenses if you mess up, you're going to die anyways? You might as well kill the boss sooner and put him down before he can even do that if possible. And that is a legitimate strategy for a lot of these bosses because many of the attacks will one shot you. So you might as well just kill them sooner and learn how to dodge. Now for the most part, I would recommend you do build resistances and I would invest in gear that will keep you safe, but also give you some damage, especially in those weapon slots. I would invest my devines, I would invest my exalts now because you're essentially investing in your future. If you start doing more damage now, you'll make more money down the road and you can always sell good items back down the road if you get an upgrade. So you're essentially just loaning it to yourself. Prioritize cast speed or attack speed. Prioritize getting your curses and marks up and running and crit damage and crit chance are very good, but some builds don't need them. Thank you so much for watching. Hopefully you enjoyed and I'll see you soon. Bye bye."}
