{"video_id": "MvwmmjVIes0", "transcript": " In PoE2 there's quite a bit which goes into determining how much damage you're actually doing with your spells and attacks. While the tooltips can be helpful, they're not all encompassing and there's a little bit of ambiguity in the numbers that they're spitting out. So in this video we're going to try to go through all of the stuff which contributes to your spell and attack damage. Let's jump in. Let's start off by talking about attacks. This will be our player character over here and this will be a monster which we are attacking. For the most part, attacks are going to scale off of your weapon damage. Now this is different than spells but we're going to loop spells into this whole flow in a moment. But yeah, let's focus on attacks for now. So attacks, for the most part, they'll have a little percentage modifier which dictates how much damage they are actually going to do based on your weapons core damage. So it'll be like, you know, usually between like 50 to 150% there's some edge cases which are a little bit more extreme, but that's kind of the core number for your attack damage. There are a couple modifiers which apply here first. Affects is that you can be looking on on gear or weapons. The first of these are local modifiers. Local modifiers are typically worded like asex physical damage to attacks. They will typically be reflected in the tooltip for the weapon so like it'll be like plus, you know, 7 to 12 physical damage and you'll see the weapons physical damage will actually be increased by that much as well. The other set of these that are kind of impacting weapon flat damage before any other modifiers apply are like ads, x damage to attack modifiers that are non local. So like you might see these on like rings or gloves stuff like this. These contribute to this core weapon damage and there's not much more to it. They're just going to add that much damage to the rolls and then all of the rest of the math here will be derived from these values. This is what kind of leads to your core attack value. Spells differ from attacks here because spells kind of start this whole process here. Like spells don't have much going on that does these initial modifications to the core damage that they're doing. And the spell itself is what dictates how much damage it's going to do. It doesn't come off of the weapon, it doesn't come off anything else. It's just the spell and it'll explicitly say how much damage the spell does as it's based. Both attack abilities and spells can be doing multiple types of damage at once. For example, you could have something that's adding like plus four fire damage to attacks. So that attack will do its core physical damage of the ability and then also the four fire damage that the aphixes granting. So we'll say that we've got like physical elemental and chaos damage all coming out of our kind of core attacks. And again a single attack can be doing more than one of these. From here we start to get into the realm of damage conversion where this starts to feel a little bit complicated. But I think we can we can make it through. Okay, so damage conversion actually happens in two steps. The first step is skill based conversion. This kind of comes from attacks and spells and they will say in them like converts some amount of physical damage being dealt. So like the weapon damage that you're doing or and any modifiers to a different damage type. So we'll keep using lightning arrow as an example. And let's just say that after the attack percentage modifier like lightning arrow is doing 100 damage. Just kind of as its core we got a 100 physical damage from our weapon. Additionally, let's say that we've got like a ring or some item giving us a plus 10 fired damage to attacks just for our example. So we've got this kind of 110 damage base coming through. Because we're dealing this 100 physical damage coming out of this base conversion for a 100 damage lightning arrow we'd be doing 60 physical 40 lightning and 10 fire from this like ring or whatever is giving us plus 10 fired damage. Then we have the second set of damage conversion and this is where damage gain is going to come into play. So let's say you've got like a passive in your skill tree or armor that's doing some percentage of damage conversions something like that. So we'll call this others and gain. So just to continue our example here. Let's say we've got a piece of armor that's doing 50% of elemental damage is converted to cold. And then let's also say we've got a ring or something that's giving us gain 10% chaos damage. We'll make this pink for chaos. So what does our damage look like from here? So we would still have our core 60% physical. Our lightning damage will be reduced to 20 lightning damage because again half of it's being converted to cold. Our fire damage will also be reduced to five because half of it's being converted. That will result in this 25 cold damage. And now we've got 10% of kind of our core damage. We have 110 core damage here. So we have 10% gained is chaos. So that gives us 11 chaos damage. I do want to add a quick note here that if you somehow find yourself over converting and either of these conversion steps. So let's say you have like a hundred percent of physical damage converted to chaos and 50% of physical damage converted to fire and 50% converted to cold. These values will get normalized to a hundred percent maximum and then computed from there. So because we're at 200% total here what would end up happening is 50% of your damage would actually end up being chaos. 25% fire and 25% cold. The most you can actually sum to is 100%. So the values kind of all get summed up to 100 and normalized if you have a given type of damage yielding more than 100% conversion. Overall though within each of these steps there's no like looping of conversion or anything like that conversion kind of happens all at once in this one big line and all damage conversion occurs here. After conversion we are in the realm of our first set of modifiers. So we'll do this and we'll call these modifiers but these are only increased and decreased modifiers. There are a couple different categories of these modifiers. The first type will say something like plus 10% again increased damage with projectiles. You'll see these on the passive tree or on gear, gems, necklaces stuff like that and they will typically be qualifying on something that the spell or attack ability will have listed as the type of damage it's doing. Something to note here if an attack does like multiple stages so if it like fires a projectile which then explodes the projectile modifiers will only apply to the projectile and the AOE modifiers will largely only apply to the AOE unless that AOE is derivative of the projectile damage in which case the projectile modifiers probably also impact the AOE it's really difficult to tell but that's our best guess currently. The other type of these increased modifiers are typically based on damage type so they'll say something like plus 10% increased physical damage. This pool at large is usually pretty busy. There's a lot of stuff which ends up converting to this number so like for this example let's say we've got a bunch of these. We've got like another plus 10% physical and then we've got like eight more plus 10% physical. We'll continue with our example from there. Let's say we're still kind of talking about this attack that's 60 physical 20 lightning etc. We then can compute this so we would say like we've got plus 10% with projectiles so that would give us six more physical and then all these physical damage increases which are giving us another 60 total because we've got plus 100% so we've got the 66 physical. Then our lightning damage will only be impacted by our with project dials because again we'll say this is a projectile ability so it's got 2% more lightning. The fire and cold damage would be about the same story so it would probably be like plus one fire after rounding plus two or three cold damage etc. The thing that matters here is that all of these increased or decreased modifiers get applied in kind of one step here. They are all added together into one big sum and then that modification is applied to your damage but there are some modifiers which then multiply after this step occurs. These are modifiers with the more or less keywords so they'll explicitly say like deal 10% more lightning damage or deal 50% less range damage. Something to that effect. Those are actually multiplicative. Let's say we've got something giving us 50% more physical and 50% more with projectile skills. Let's continue our math then we've got 60 physical here and then we're adding 66 more so we'd be at 126 physical damage total. These multiplier steps these more or less modifiers would also be being applied to our other damage if they meet its qualifications but we're just going to continue with physical just for the sake of our example. So we'd be dealing 126 physical damage initially. Then we'd go through our first 50% more step. 50% more of 126 is 189 I think if I'm doing my math right. And then because we have another 50% more because this is a projectile skill we get another 50% more of that. That would be 284, 283, 284. So another big takeaway here is that these more or less multiplicative steps are very important because they are kind of a separate damage bucket. So if you can just get a little bit more even if it's just like 10% more physical damage that's way more potent than 10% increase physical damage because as I said this modifiers increased pool is typically very large or like hundreds of percent modification here. So adding 10% more isn't that impactful but if you can get a multiplier or multiple multiplier stacking your damage ramps up very quickly. Speaking of multiplicative damage this then brings us to crits how do crits work. So crits are a percentage chance you have a percentage chance to crit with an attack where this comes from will typically be on your weapon if this is a weapon skill your weapon will actually have a core crit percentage or if this is a spell your spell will indicate it's kind of core crit chance. This number can also be modified by percent crit chance multipliers and those are also additive so let's say you had like a 10% crit chance on an attack and then you have something giving you 10% more you have 20% crit chance with that attack it's straightforward we don't need to make it any more complicated than that. Crit damage itself is also pretty simple it's just another multiplier it's like these more or less values that's just then just 2xing or giving you 100% more damage as the last step of the attack. This crit bonus multiplier can also be scaled up with an aphix I think it's like plus crit damage bonus or something like that I'll put an example on the screen here but what that thing does is let's say you have like 50% crit bonus what that will then yield is 2.5x on critical hits instead of just 2x and again this can be pretty potent because this is another multiplicative pool that's not really being impacted by much normally so if you can get a little bit of extra crit bonus here that usually can go a long way but then we're kind of through so let's round out our example here so we've got 284 physical damage coming in we'd be multiplying it by this 2.5x crit multiplier and dealing 560 odd whatever that is but don't forget that we're also dealing lightning fire and cold damage kind of through these last steps of the chain so this multiplier would also impact those but again yeah from there we're kind of through so now we're dealing damage to the monster if you have any questions or it seems I missed anything feel free to leave a comment I'll pin one that has kind of frequently asked questions or corrections or if there's another video you'd like to see or you found this helpful please leave a comment as well if you like these kind of pseudo deep dives into the mechanics of POE consider subscribing I'll be going through more of these in increasing detail later but anyway I think that's a wrap for today thank you for watching have a good one let's start off with talking about attacks this will be our player character over here and this is some cyclops monster"}
