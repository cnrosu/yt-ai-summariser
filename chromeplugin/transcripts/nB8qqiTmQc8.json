Yeah, killed it. Yeah, I killed it. It's dead now It's on the road. It's Decomposing in any case Folks for a few years now if you've been tuned into this channel of not no big deal welcome I've been yapping Uncontrollably about the theoretical potential benefits of what are called non-androgenic anabolic Drugs that increase your skeletal muscle mass look who all deeply desire But at the same time have limited or no androgenic side effects What are androgenic side effects? They include all the typical things that steroids give you because they do increase muscle mass, but they have all these androgenic side effects hair loss Acne increased body hair, which I'd known nothing about Worse lipid profile not good potential strain and liver in some cases definitely increases in aggression and anxiety prostate enlargement Testicular atrophysi after restart your testes after you come off and for females debiting of the voice collatoral enlargement, which is so Being hot I will not make excuses about that, but most ladies find it confusing and fast Mastrolyregularities and of course facial hair growth which females tend to find displeasing in most cases So the question is why do steroids cause these and the answer is steroids are not a muscle growth drug They are a drug that is just designed to masculineize animals like all mammals and humans and so when you increase the amount of Androgen the amount of androgenic anabolic steroids inside of a human it does all the things that molecules do To make you more manlike which means getting more jacked for sure But also means making more aggressive making less verbally social making more anxious making you have poor lipid profiles and all the other stuff Of course hair growth and all that stuff these are side effects that are annoying they're bad for your health And it makes it so that steroids are not like hey take this drug and it'll just get you jack There's a laundry list of problems with them and I've done plenty of them and they suck. It's cool tool, but it's really really rough edge tool If we could just have a drug That built a crappler of muscle but had no such androgenic side effects it would be amazing and in fact This is now the reality because the brilliant minds at the Regeneron pharmaceuticals corporation Have just such a drug and they have published research about it and I want to tell you all about this drug until I'm just salivating about it In fact, it's not just one drug. It's a combo drug therapy. It's two two drugs at the same time Travagramab good luck saying that one and Gareth's map good luck saying that one also who makes these drug names up I swear to God it's got it there's a high probability in my mind that a gentleman named Trevor and a gentleman named Garrett Co-discover these drugs and they just named it after themselves. Well Trevor and Garrett's drug. That's what I'm calling So Travagramab is a myostatin antagonist. I'll get to what that is in just a little bit and Gareth's map is an active and a antagonist both drugs work by reducing the activity of myostatin and active in a Myostatin and active in a Their predominant roles in skeletal muscle are to cap to hold down to reduce how much muscle you grow in any given time and When these drugs uncork those caps reduce the activity of myostatin and active in a you get this Radical unleashing of completely natural in a sense muscle growth that your body wants to do all the time But it has these two substances. It makes it sell these two proteins Myostatin and active in a capping this muscle growth all the time What these drugs do is these and uncork them, you know in a dose dependent matter They uncorking as partial and then complete if you take a crap out of these drugs So these new drugs uncap your body's natural potential for muscle growth How well do they do it? Well good news. We have an incredibly well-conducted research study by regeneran pharmaceuticals from their Pre-stage one clinical trials. These are done on non-human primates little teeny monkeys You know the outbreak Scott remember outbreak that moved from the 90s. Oh, don't ask monkeys that everyone has super creepy, right? Monkeys are I don't the monkeys at all, but if they're gonna be given advanced antibiotic drugs I love monkeys monkeys y'all family to me Just I don't look them in the eye because I'll throw a poop at you or whatever the hell Non-human primates which means it's very small monkeys So the amount of muscle gain and fat loss they're experiencing is measured in the grams and not in the kilograms The teeny teeny tiny it's easier to do teeny teeny tiny because they experience rapid changes and it's easier reminder to them and You know, it's I guess they did they did put them to sleep and shove them in a dexa which is quite impressive so Here's the deal We have four groups of monkeys Getting four different treatments One group of monkeys had to die it the restricted their calories a little bit and they died of nattie These are nattie monkeys right there are monkeys that go on forums and talk about everyone's a drug addict They accuse everyone of taking drugs cope Then there are monkeys that received somagletide aka ozempic which is a drug that is a modern weight loss drug mostly works by reducing your appetite Another group of monkeys group three Received only the myostatin blocker drug right and then group four received the myostatin blocker drug and The act of an a blocker drug that real dual therapy that tip of the spear that's what we're testing there So for groups nattie monkeys somagletide only monkeys myostatin only monkeys and then combo therapy monkeys What What occurred we have a graph for you right here Pause the video and look at the graph for a while. I'm gonna explain it so you can pause and look after this is Wild Wild wild wild results What are we looking at here The monkeys that did the nattie life and just died at hardcore and probably bitched about it a lot They lost about 400 grams remember these are not small these are not large animals so 400 grams to them is actually a lot They lost 400 grams of body fat With about aish these are very approximate numbers 400 ish grams of body fat In about 15 ish grams of muscle loss so something thereabouts plus or minus 2x that number So they lost a lot of fat and a very very small amount of muscle. I mean, that's a really good ratio at 415 That's dope. That's almost no muscle loss Monkeys taking somagletide did what you would predict they lost way way way more fat instead of 400 grams for the drug free monkeys The somagletide monkeys lost about 700 grams of body fat thereabouts almost double which is dope the problem with somagletide though Because it's such a powerful reducer of any calories you're taking in that the magnitude of your caloric deficit skyrockets and we know in almost every case a very high caloric deficit Leaves to a higher proportion of muscle loss. It's just it's not a sonagletide thing It's not that the molecules making lose fat or sorry It's not like the molecule is making you lose muscle in some special way It's just driving a crazy crazy deficit and then you lose more muscle So those monkeys that were on somagletide they do they did lose 700 grams versus 400 grams of fat Amazing almost 2x but they lost close to about a hundred grams of muscle with it still Hey, 7 to 1 ratio is really good, but like man They lost maybe like five or six times more muscle than the monkeys that just did the shit natty so Okay, all right trade-offs and let's take a known trade-off no big deal Here's the thing the monkeys that were given somagletide and Travagramab which is the mild statin block Lost about 1300 grams of body fat. Okay real quick Nadi monkeys 400 gram loss of fat Somagletide monkeys 700 gram loss of fat I can't I can laugh when I say this the triple the dot the the monkeys that got somagletide and The mastatin blocker trogramab lost 1300 grams of fat that is almost double the somagletide group and More than three times the drug free group and Those monkeys lost about 15 grams of muscle Duff We're talking about the same losses as the monkeys who lost 400 grams of fat natty Imagine a diet in which you lose the rough equipment equivalent. I'll get to those numbers a sec of 400 grams of fat You lose a little teeny bit of muscle now. I give you two things If you some aglatide and give you traumatic and you lose Not 400 grams of fat 1300 grams of fat and you lose no more muscle Then you lost just on 400 grams of fat. It's insane. It's insane. It's insane. This by itself will be a revolution We now officially have a drug in trovogramab alone that Nullifies the muscle loss effect seen from the massive deficits of somagletide So all those are internet articles you've been reading all those blog posts you've been reading about people who say I'll somagletide lose this muscle. It's true because it lets you lose a lot of weight gone gone But it gets better Monkeys that took the combo therapy. They took somagletide They took trovogramab and they took geritis map and geritis map is the active in a inhibitor So now we got my stand inhibitor in the works and active in a those monkeys Lost 1400 ish grams of fat a little bit more Notably more than the monkeys that were just on the my stand inhibitor than group three but not a ton more But check this out Those monkeys didn't lose 15 grams of Fat sorry good god those monkeys didn't lose 15 grams of muscle like the drug free monkeys did Or like the myastatin monkeys did They didn't lose a hundred grams of muscle like the somagletide monkeys did They gained on a deficit by the way Monkeys don't resistance trained by the way They gained 450 or so grams of muscle during the course of this diet which was 20 weeks long by the way So we're going From dieting drug free you lose a little bit of muscle almost not at all But you don't lose a whole lot of fat to dieting with somagletide We use a lot more fat, but the substantial amount of muscle nothing crazy, but that's annoying To adding in the myastatin inhibitor Travagramab and all of a sudden you are going to lose almost no muscle just a little bit of muscle loss But you are losing almost double the amount of fat that you did with the somagletide and close to Just actually over three times the amount of fat that you did drug free and In the combo therapy the triple therapy somagletide Travagramab and greatest map We got the GLP one We've got the myastatin inhibitor and we have got the Active and A inhibitor all combined into one into one vehicle into one drug You're losing even more fat Then you did with just myastatin by a little bit You're now losing about double the fat that you did with somagletide alone and Close to four times the amount of fat you lost drug free what But you are gaining The amount of muscle that is roughly equivalent to the amount of fat that you lost drug free This is insane. This is insane Let's talk about some insights of this because this is totally wild stuff this Kind of drug specifically this drug therapy is likely to transfer to humans because monkeys have a huge huge amount of Commonalities with us almost the same biology and such studies are currently ongoing They're in stage two clinical trials for this drug with humans now, which is like, uh, Scott How do we get into this clinical trial man? I'm sick. I'm dying out here, baby Sign me up look at me in my no muscle mass. I need help. Please regenerate please Somebody emailed me for regenerate These trials are currently ongoing There are multiple other pharmaceutical laboratories mega corporations that are working around the clock on similar treatments because we now know for years That somagletide and trans appetite and soon-to-be-retachra-tide and all these weight loss drugs are Phenomenal for helping people lose weight, but they don't really help you retain muscle And now a lot of people losing weight and they're getting skinny and they have less muscle and they're getting all these health effects and all these cosmetic effects They don't like this is a known problem to a pharmaceutical industry And now a ton of labs are rushing to get you the most advanced muscle growth drugs that they can make Already they are in research The combo therapy that triple triple threat of somagletide, Travagromab and Gretis Mab on fat loss and muscle gain are what we would expect with somagletide plus a really solid dose of Mega steroids for someone who's never taken steroids before except with zero Androgenic side effects no hair growth no voice deepening no aggression no bad lipid profiles none of that stuff How big of a deal are these effects if we're gonna Strapley know this is just pretend land for a second just to get our minds right Nothing one to one here. So just let's just just hypothesis stuff Let's take the primate results and map them onto a human result This is very likely what it's going to happen or similar Imagine you have an identical twin Scott. What would you do if you had an identical twin other than a master beating? in front of each other every day. I would do like twin shenanigans You know we're like dress up the same and get into hijinks hi jinks You uh did like date the same girl, but you alternate alternatively date her She's like remember we talked about like that one funny thing you said about chainsaws last time and your twins like oh Yeah, of course. Yeah, love chainsaws man. Yes. He's texting you under the table I want that did you talk to her about shit like that However, you could do something even even cooler. You can both get on a diet. Isn't that nice? So imagine you have an identical twin and you're both a decent bit out of shape Let's say you're about 200 pounds both and you're both at about 20% body fat Your twin is a nadi for life. There's a number four in there somewhere He's going to diet for five months straight reasonably drug-free And extrapolating this primate data. He would lose his group one monkey He would you come up to your twin you're like your group one monkey's like shot up Anyway He would lose about eight pounds of fat and lose less than a pound of muscle He would at the end of this diet at the end of five months be about 192 pounds And around 16.5% body fat. Hey, look better. Scott. That's better. Right? That's cool That's enough for people that work to be like, hey, what are you doing? Looking good However, you the other identical twin took all the ship baby triple threat Some agglatine Travagramab, Geratismab you took it all At the end of that five-month diet extrapolating from this primate data You would lose about 28 pounds of fat while gaining nine pounds of muscle That means while your twin was about 192 pounds at the end of the diet you would be about 181 And your twin is around 16.5% fat at the end of the diet. You would be around 6.5% body fat Scott make this make sense. It doesn't Modern pharma unleashed you guys. Nobody planned. We look nobody's planned anymore The difference in visual appearance between you and your twin would be wild I mean we're in a completely different era of body composition enhancement You want to burn fat you want to build muscle? Regeneron pharmaceuticals has the Sword of Athena to the clouds holy shit Let's just talk about really quick some of the implications of when this tidal wave of modern drugs hits the market around 2027 2028 or so after they go through the just perilously and stupidly long FDA approval process Such drugs are likely going to have very minimal side effects Most likely the side effects are going to come from increasing muscle mastil radically Which means a probably going to make you hungrier and require you to eat more protein But you can just take a slightly higher dose of somagletitrize appetite or retatretide offset that so no big deal The effects will be a huge positive on strength gain course adding nine pounds of muscle is going to do something It's going to be a way better look and a huge boost to overall health Because more muscle means better controlled in lower blood sugar lower blood fats and about 20 other major health benefits I just don't have time to get into having more muscle is usually a really really really awesome thing Here's the thing also we have to extrapolate This won't be the only drug out within a few years After this drug releases or really within a few months of its release because other labs are working on their own competitors right now There will be numerous other drugs out and these drugs over years and years Maybe over months and months with advanced AI research at that point in in history They're going to get better and better and better increasing how much muscle That they help you gain decreasing how much fat Uh, that you hold on your body that will help you lose more fat and they'll decrease side effects too If there really are any side effects to speak of which i'm sure there will be but over time the drugs will be less and less and less side effects More muscle gain and more fat lost craze Here's the thing another implication folks who currently use steroids and suffer through all their side effects For a large fraction of my life we really have to ask themselves a question of why the hell are we using steroids at all? I think almost everyone is currently using steroids We'll just switch to TRT testosterone replacement therapy or just go drug-free and just to feel good and performile And then the muscle growth part is just going to be handled by these drugs which you do it much more directly and way way better In addition to this It's not just for fat loss and some i say nine pounds of muscle over five months is an insane amount of muscle to gain But it's not just some muscle gain and a radical fat loss If you take a low level of some agglatine, transapotite, or retatrotite these weight loss drugs or not at all And you take a decent amount of these muscle building drugs And you eat in a slight surplus scot are we even imagine like imagine eating a 500 calorie surplus when you're on the ship I do it's actually like you're delts are gonna like cap off your head and you're gonna die or some shit like that You are gonna be able to gain muscle at levels we barely see with the highest doses of steroids most most most people can't sustain for about a few weeks With 10 times less side effects if after a few generations any side effects whatsoever Another thing is this okay not everyone wants to be like a gigantic Godzilla like you know i'm saying busting up Tokyo If you train only or mostly muscles which you think improve your aesthetics for example your forms Your biceps triceps shoulders upper pecs upper back a little bit of legs and some some decent calf training You can radically change your physique because generally when people train and even if they take steroids or even if they don't They train whole body if your whole body gets more muscular and like based on your genetics like everything's bigger And your leaner which looks cooler, but you don't exactly have that aesthetic flow like your arms is still a bit small And shoulder small compared to your chest and back your quads and glutes are really big But your calves aren't that big so you look kind of look like you have peg legs With these drugs are so powerful that they'll maintain or increase muscles You're not even training and so if you take a moderate dose of this drug even a low dose and train living crap out of muscles You want to increase that a really aesthetic shoulders upper back upper chest arms forms and calves specifically You're going to take your body and make it way more aesthetically appealing basically you're gonna turn into some version of me Scott, can we get these pictures thrown up here? Some version of me Into some version that looks more like Jared Feather IFB depro Because that's really what we all want to look like if we're being honest ourselves in the middle of the night while touching ourselves Of course look at Jared's body So not only are people going to be able to begin as jacked as they like But they're going to be able to look more aesthetic which is a huge huge unlock Here's another one females will stop taking steroids all together We'll see a renaissance of female physique sport the likes of which we've never seen You'll see way more muscular females But without any of the pimples or the hair loss or the hair growth on a whole range of shit women just don't want Regular folks Who aren't even in the gym because they have such crap genetics or just just have not been able to get just get their Clause into the fitness industry They'll be able to hit the gym and sculpt their bodies to their desire Will some folks just take these drugs and not go to the gym absolutely god bless them whatever We don't need them in the gym crowding up the shit But at least now they're in way better health way more muscle way less fat our medical system saves billions of dollars And people are healthier and happier and look better. This is a big deal And my prediction on gym specifically Is it we might see a decline in overall general gym attendance or maybe about the same But we're gonna see a second renaissance the first one was in the in the 70s 80s really in the 80s if you think about it of hardcore gym attendance Because hardcore folks like most of you watching many of you watching If you're given a drug that radically increases muscle growth That doesn't mean you stop going to the gym that means you go to the gym more because you're more empowered to make a more Perfect version of yourself Scott can you imagine when steroids really started becoming popular in the 80s that people just left the gym and droves Like I'll just do steroids. I don't need the gym anymore That's backwards right yeah, like Scott if you're given this drug and you're able to train your body to make it even more aesthetic are you leaving the gym or are you hitting the gym or head that baby we're hitting that hard Because now there's you guys a real talk like human to human Folks who are older Folks who already really jacked folks who aren't jacked at all have just shit genetics real talk Like it sucks to go to the gym and it just claw for these minimal gains Or just like work out for a year and see nothing happen or just slow the decline of muscularity in your 40s or 50s That blows it's good that you're doing it stay in the gym but it blows This drug and drugs like it could end that forever now you get gains now you come to the gym and shit makes sense again And every month your body looks better wow I could go on and on about the benefits, but for the purposes of time I got to cut this video off in just a little bit suffice it to say That massive changes are inbound for the incredibly better for all of us It's likely that these drugs past FDA approval sometime 2027 2028 so it's just a few years away Which means that if you are considering using steroids And you haven't used them yet. Don't use them just don't use them you won't need them soon These drugs are a category above steroids entirely They outclass them steroids are going to be dead in the water Why take steroids if you have these drugs? Yeah, I mean for strength enhancement if you're a powerlifter some shit like that Cool, but for body composition for getting jacked and lean these drugs will end steroids. That is my sincere prediction When these drugs come out They're going to get us much closer to the Purpose of what I call the aesthetic revolution. This is a big part of it And the aesthetic revolution is one goal Getting everyone into the bodies they want to be in that is our goal at RP That is our express you only reason the company exists We have the RPI hypertrophy app link in the description if you guys want to train and get your get your swall on Soon that app will have mega help and you can use the app plus these drugs to become the absolute most jacked Lean and aesthetic version of yourself so you can it poses properly. Are you excited? I sure should am We have a link to the entire regeneron presentation in the description give that a click look through it and Basque and marvel at advanced pharmaceuticals you ready I'm ready. I'll see you next time"}
