It's taboo to do that, but to criticize an employer that also owns extremely lethal technologies and surveillance technologies that are highly invasive and used in war zones is something else entirely. It's 2025. We're all kind of used to government surveillance. The idea that we're all being watched all the time and don't own our own personal data has become normalized. We're also used to the military spending vast amounts of our money on just a few giant defense contractors. But one tech company wants to change both of those things and become the ultimate military contractor and the ultimate orbiter of all of our data. Palette here is here to disrupt and make our institutions we partner with the very best in the world and when it's necessary to scare enemies and on occasion kill them. Check out Palette here shares surging 22% after the company cited a boom in demand for its AI software from the US government. We're doing it. We're doing it and I'm sure you're enjoying this as much as I am. Palette here a tech company based here in Denver claims they can revolutionize government systems with their data analysis software newly powered by artificial intelligence. They've been hired by the Department of Defense, the FBI, local police departments and even the IRS and Wendy's to take in the information those organizations collect collect even more information and use that data to draw conclusions. It can be used to completely reconfigure organizations and technology its reality what systems matter what information matters what processes matter how they are structured what biases are introduced at each of those stages. We talked to a former Palette here employee dug into decades of research and listened to hours of Alex Carp's own words to unwrap the layers of Palette here's carefully cultivated sales pitch how they capitalize on fear uncertainty and unrest. I don't think in win-lose I think in domination this is a company built for bad times bad times meet strong finances internally bad times are very good for Palette here because we build products that are robust that are built for danger. Let's rewind a little. Palette here's story starts with one of the most effective things a company can have for sales fear after the September 11th attacks the United States government began expanding surveillance both at home and abroad this was of course a boom for the defense industry at large simultaneously the Silicon Valley tech industry was growing fast and making people in a once obscure industry very very rich very very quickly like the founders and executives at PayPal known as the PayPal mafia Elon Musk read Hoffman the LinkedIn guy and Peter Teal when PayPal was sold Teal had millions of dollars burning the Holins pocket and an idea PayPal had developed systems for detecting fraud and crimes on the platform what if they could use similar thinking to analyze the world at large so Teal pulled from his network to build out a new company one of the first hires was Teal's Stanford Law School roommate Alex Carp who'd gone on after Stanford to get a PhD in not business or computer science or engineering but neoclassical social theory the name of the company Palantir after the Palantiri from Jero Tokins Lord of the Rings in Lord of the Rings the Palantir stone is a magical object that allows its users to predict the future or just see what's going on in a remote location it was originally created by the elves it was meant to be used for good purposes it is is potentially very dangerous technology it's very powerful long have you hunted me so that's middle earth but what does Palantir do in a regular what we do is we use what legal scholars call predicate based to search so we would look at you and then we would go out and say oh there's lots of different things in your life that may be indicative of someone being someone involved in bad behavior put simpler they make software that makes it easier for their customers to collect and analyze data and then act on that analysis with and without AI by 2013 10 years after their founding Palantir's client list included the FBI the CIA the NSA the Marines the Air Force special operations command and more did your company helped to track and kill or sound up in the lot of you know we can never I'll tell you the only closest thing to an answer is like there are when you when you look at the like when you open the paper and look in the news about these kind of things there's a two thirds chance depending on the country involved that somehow my company was involved fundamentally the mission that is pushed to employees is that we're solving the world's hardest problems and supporting Western institutions that is the main driver of sort of this militaristic culture that has developed inside of Palantir if you do not feel comfortable supporting legitimate efforts of America and its allies in the context of war don't join Palantir this entire message of like we are the most lethal we are the most able to to surveil and process large amounts of data you have created the system which you call kill chain privately publicly the lawyers have some innocuous so I would like to check for the immigration of unwanted blah blah blah some some term we're supposed to okay let's and for me it's the kill chain kill chain sounds good kill chain isn't an original term created by Palantir it's the more general military verbiage for the series of decisions leading from identifying a target to taking their life Palantir's contract added their software and artificial intelligence to the kill chain it's quicker and better and safer and more violent it's tech that won helped market it reduces the distance you have to the problem but when you're able to take a step back and really see all the narratives and how they were shaped and the actual application of these technologies your world starts falling apart which is something that you know definitely happened to me one didn't leave Palantir entirely for ethical reasons he just got another job but the reason he eventually started speaking out against Palantir came after watching the Israeli invasion of Gaza following the October 7th attacks Palantir has contracts with the Israeli defense forces the exact nature of the contracts is opaque intentionally but there is evidence to suggest that Palantir's artificial intelligence tech was used for selecting targets in Gaza. Carp doesn't mind the controversy in fact it's part of the marketing Palantir will even pick up the projects that other companies rejected for political reasons we are very comfortable being unpopular Carp doesn't think controversy will lose Palantir customers whatever is pissing them off they're still buying the product Wendy's hired Palantir to help with their supply chain Palantir works with health insurance companies to build AI for Denials management to protect revenue do you want Palantir's AI making decisions about what care is covered for you and your loved ones they also do business with four profit hospitals major investment banks and even other defense contractors in 2024 Palantir brought in nearly 2.9 billion dollars in revenue 55% of which came from government sources with the vast majority being American so let's look at their pitch to the American government last year Palantir CTO Shamsankar put out a presentation and white paper called the defense reformation he cites the last summer which was a secretive 1993 meeting between defense industry executives and the deputy secretary of defense over a dozen companies walked in and only a few walked out that dinner is often cited as the origin of our consolidated military industrial complex and to me I think this was the definitive moment that kicked off the financialization of defense from that point forward it became all about buybacks and dividends and leverage ratios criticizing the financialization of the defense industry calling out stock buybacks that doesn't sound like a defense executive that sounds more like the exact argument about the defense industry that we have made before I think what's interesting to me about Palantir is how they co-opt language of revolution but Sankar's argument did work on somebody Uncle Sam the defense innovation board and advisory group within the department's defense cited Sankar's presentation multiple times in their 2024 report on why the DOD needs to divert more of their budget to emerging technology that's giving money to Palantir there's a reason Palantir just replaced Ford Motors in the S&P 100 in a month after Trump was elected the Trump administration is an ideal customer for what Palantir is selling first there are many former Palantir employees sprinkled across the Trump administration from inside DOGE to foreign policy advisors to high level technology appointees and Palantir co-founder Peter Teal heavily invested in the company is also heavily invested in president Trump and vice president Vance he was a major campaign donor to both then the stated goal of DOGE is to streamline and combine government data which is exactly what Palantir does the ways that the government is to fraud it is that the computer systems don't talk to each other and obviously carpe is loving it disruption in the end of the day exposes things that aren't working there'll be ups and down there's a revolution some people get their heads cut off like you know it's like we're we're expecting to see really unexpected things and to win and what is winning according to Palantir this is CTO Shams and Carr in 2021 turning to government we continue to advance our mission of becoming the US government central operating system as we extend our footprint across defense healthcare and civilian agencies the government's operating system they want everything to funnel through Palantir Palantir already has contracts with the IRS going through taxpayer data to save auditors time by finding the easiest audits to pursue now wired reports DOGE will likely hire Palantir to create unified software for the entire IRS a mega API that would allow anyone with access to view and possibly alter all IRS data in one place that's all of your financial information and they have multiple contracts with the Department of Health and Human Services including nearly one hundred million dollars to support HHS's core administrative data and applications to manage and just and access data securely across business domains HHS's core responsibility is Medicare and Medicaid that's control over millions of Americans health records and their access to healthcare so what does it mean for one contractor to have all that power data and taxpayer money as profit especially as AI gets involved as we kind of increasingly live in a simulated world we lose touch with reality and the human decisions that matter and we move closer towards governance by algorithm not only made by decisions of automated artificial intelligence systems which is a problem but more importantly subject to decisions made by the people who are influencing these AI systems and creating them in order to fill an agenda for whatever their profits seeking or control seeking objectives are and when I see DOGE kind of going into every agency and addressing the IT Department first I see it as an opportunity to try to change reality itself but so what why am I telling you all of this Palantir has no problem being seen as big brother as all powerful as lethal even we're at the brink of using these technologies potentially to to run our government to run our battlefields and our personal lives using artificial intelligence as a sort of panacea solution across federal departments and especially when they're again wielded by people with a very distinct agenda what's everyone at risk it almost feels like that's been the plan all along here's co-founder Peter Tio in 2010 at Libertopia a libertarian conference speaking about tech companies and government the basic idea was that we could never win an election on on on on on getting certain things because we were in such a small minority but maybe you could actually unilaterally change the world without having to constantly convince people and beg people and plead with people who are never going to agree with you through technological means and this is where I think technology is this incredible alternative to politics and here's Alex Carp in 2009 on civil liberties with regards to Palantir's work the central question in my view of civil liberties is how it's not if the government has data because let's assume the government has much data as a health insurance company it's how is that data being used is it being used in a way that's lawful meaning do they have the right to use it and is it being migrated into places is not allowed to be used we allow the we allow the enforcement of rules that the government ought to enforce and by the way my experience is they want to enforce or very least know they need to enforce and if it's framed in that way then you can have you can have what is the ultimate Silicon Valley solution one co-founder openly wants to use the power of the tech industry to affect politics the other wants his company to have oversight over how the government data they're paid to handle is used and the founders of Palantir will retain control in the company no matter what through an obscure ownership structure their class F shares grant them 49.99 percent of voting power even if they collectively own as little as 6% of the company at the start of this journey I was extremely afraid for the repercussions of this writing of speaking out but now I'm like you know even more convinced that this is absolutely necessary we can't replace our current broken system with an even more broken one and we can't let the worst people in Silicon Valley become our government it's not about whether you're actually at risk for speaking out or not it's just the idea that somebody's watching you is enough to push people into silence thank you so much for watching if you want to support more nonprofit reporting you to corporate greed don't forget to like and subscribe
