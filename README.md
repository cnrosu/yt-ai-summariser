# yt-ai-summariser

Chrome extension and Python backend for transcribing YouTube videos with the **faster-whisper** model and analysing them using GPT models. The extension, **YouTranscribe**, now provides a Material-style UI with quick actions, suggested questions and a dedicated settings page for your API key.

Transcripts are cached per video on disk and in the browser. Any questions you ask are saved in Chrome sync storage so they remain tied to your Google account and are not shared with other users. A copy of each question/answer pair is also written on the server next to the transcript for that video.

## Setup

1. Install Python 3.10 or newer and create a virtual environment (optional):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   For running the tests, also install:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   python yt_ai_server.py
   ```
   The API is now available on `http://localhost:5010`.
4. Load the `chromeplugin/` folder as an unpacked extension in Chrome to use the UI.

## Architecture

The project consists of a small Flask server and a Chrome extension that talk over HTTP.

1. The **Chrome extension** injects UI components into YouTube pages and lets you request a transcript or ask questions about a video.
2. The **server** (`yt_ai_server.py`) downloads the video audio with `yt_dlp`, transcribes it with the faster-whisper model and caches the result under `chromeplugin/transcripts/`.
3. Question/answer pairs generated by GPT are stored alongside the transcript so they can be loaded later.

See [docs/API_REFERENCE.md](docs/API_REFERENCE.md) for details on the available endpoints and how to run the server. For information about the automated test suite see [docs/TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md).
