# yt-ai-summariser

Chrome extension and Python backend for transcribing YouTube videos with Whisper and analysing them using GPT models. The extension, **YouTranscribe**, now provides a Material-style UI with quick actions, suggested questions and a dedicated settings page for your API key.

Transcripts are cached per video on disk and in the browser. Any questions you ask are saved in Chrome sync storage so they remain tied to your Google account and are not shared with other users. A copy of each question/answer pair is also written on the server next to the transcript for that video.

## Architecture

The project consists of a small Flask server and a Chrome extension that talk over HTTP.

1. The **Chrome extension** injects UI components into YouTube pages and lets you request a transcript or ask questions about a video.
2. The **server** (`yt_ai_server.py`) downloads the video audio with `yt_dlp`, transcribes it with the Whisper model and caches the result under `chromeplugin/transcripts/`.
3. Question/answer pairs generated by GPT are stored alongside the transcript so they can be loaded later.

See [docs/SERVER_API.md](docs/SERVER_API.md) for details on the available endpoints and how to run the server.
